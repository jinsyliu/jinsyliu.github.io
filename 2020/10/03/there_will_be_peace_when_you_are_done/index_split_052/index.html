</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">What made being on Supernatural memorable for me? There’s a story behind the answer.</p><p class="calibre_1">The short violin version is that Supernatural came along when I had not worked for exactly twelve months. This was back in 2009 and 2010, and it had been twelve months of auditions and meetings with people saying, “We like you, but . . .” Twelve months of the Hollywood bullshit, and I had not been able to book anything. A year of hitting the pavement, as they say. Suddenly, after years and years of working, I was unable to land a job. I said to myself, Well, maybe it’s time to get out, maybe I’ll throw in the towel. Maybe this time God is trying to tell me that I should bow out and do something else.</p><p class="calibre_1">Those thoughts were hitting me very strongly when my agent called. She and I were very close, and still are to this day, so she knew that I was near to the end of the acting road. I remember telling her that if nothing happens soon, that’s it for me. She said to hold on. “Let me see what I can find.” She called back within twenty-four hours and said there’s a great role for the world’s first vampire on Supernatural, and I said okay, I’ll do it. I’ll go in and give it my very best, but if I don’t book it, that’s it.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00084.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_30">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">So my agent sent me over the material, which was a good nine pages of solid dialogue and scenes. Often in these cases, they want to make sure they’ve got the right person, so they pretty much give you everything that’s in the script. Then they want you to do that in the room with five or six or seven people as the audition. When I read the script, I thought it was a great role. I had also read for the role of Crowley previously, which not many people know, and for another couple of roles, including an angel. The Supernatural producers knew who I was, and I was on their radar, so I thought, Well, at least they still think of me. I also knew that Sera Gamble, an old friend of mine, was now producer and showrunner. So I was determined to go in and rock and roll and give it my best, because whoever got the role would be lucky to get it.</p><p class="calibre_1">I walked into the audition and the first person I saw was Sera, whom I hadn’t seen in years. I tried to keep my cool because you don’t want to walk in and just start hugging and handshaking everyone. You want to maintain a degree of calm, cool, and professional and show them that you’re ready to do the audition. But I saw Sera and I just couldn’t contain myself. I said, “OMG, it’s so good to see you! Can I just give you a hug?” She said yes, and then I sat down and did the audition. There’s that third eye in the back of your head sometimes that says: You know what? That felt pretty good. That’s how I felt when I finished the audition. I left the room and thought, Well, I left it all in the room, as actors say.</p><p class="calibre_1">A couple of days went by, and I got a phone call from my agent saying that I was headed to Vancouver to play the Alpha Vampire on Supernatural! I was beyond elated. I was so excited and had so many ideas about how I wanted to play the character, but because I hadn’t worked on Supernatural, I didn’t know what the vibe was and how it would be when I got to set. As I’ve told Jared and Jensen, that show has spoiled me so much, because they were so nice to me. Everyone was so nice to me, including the director, Guy Bee. It was his decision to cast me; it was apparently between me and another actor, and he chose me. We have now become very close friends, and I love him like a brother. Together we shaped the level of terror that the Alpha Vampire possesses. I brought a lot to the role already with my own ideas, and then Guy slightly pointed me in the right direction, saying to lean in a little bit that way, and he was right. It is easily one of my top-five favorite roles that I’ve had in my career.</p><p class="calibre_1">I loved the role so much that I was thrilled to come back two years later to do another episode. The first episode for the Alpha Vampire was “Family Matters” in season 5. I came back in season 7 to do “There Will Be Blood.” Coincidentally, that’s the title of one of my favorite movies of all time starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. I love that movie and I loved that it was the title for my episode of Supernatural. I also loved that episode, because it was such a powerful showdown between the Alpha Vampire—who does have a name, by the way, which I do know—and Sam and Dean Winchester. It’s a classic sort of mafia confrontation, an ultimate poker face showdown between everyone in the room who comes to the Alpha Vampire’s home. I love every interaction that the Alpha Vampire has with Sam and Dean. I’m very proud of that episode.</p><p class="calibre_1">At the end of that episode, we broke the fourth wall when I said, “See you next season.” But that never came to be. I had to move on to the next thing and put Supernatural out of my mind—which I was never able to completely do. I was always thinking about it because I loved the role and the character so much. But I went on to do The Vampire Diaries, playing the father of Bonnie, played by the lovely and talented Kat Graham. That meant that I was in Atlanta filming another show for the CW, and I thought, Well, they’re probably never going to bring me back to Supernatural anyway. I loved The Vampire Diaries, too. It was a great experience, and I loved working with Kat so much that I call her my TV daughter. After The Vampire Diaries, I was cast in the new Syfy show, The Magicians. Five years went by, and I was in Vancouver after finishing filming season 3 of The Magicians, and I’m chilling out with my dog, Buddy, and we’re going to the park or to Petco or somewhere and my agent calls and says, “Don’t go anywhere in January.” I asked why not. She said literally three days after New Year’s that I was going to be shooting an episode for season 12 of Supernatural.</p><p class="calibre_1">I said, “Bullshit!”</p><p class="calibre_1">My agent responded, “I’m sending you the script right now.”</p><p class="calibre_1">She emailed me the script and I was like, YES! I’m coming back! I knew it was going to be for the Alpha Vampire’s death, and I didn’t have a problem with that—I just wanted it to be good. A really high-stakes and well-earned death. And I think it was. I love, love, love “The Raid.” I think it’s probably my favorite episode, because I had five years to live with the Alpha Vampire in my head, and I was always thinking about him. He’s even appeared in my dreams a couple of times, just sort of walking by. I remember thinking, I’m not done with this guy yet; he still has more to say.</p><p class="calibre_1">When my agent emailed me the script, I was so excited that I just sat there and read it in my car—and I absolutely loved it. I loved that it was Sam who outsmarted the Alpha Vampire, and that it was Sam who puts the killing bullet in his head. I thought it was brilliant. I was hoping that Guy Bee would direct it, because he had directed the other two episodes I was in, and it felt like me and Guy, that was our creation together. But Johnny MacCarthy directed it, and he did a really nice job.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’m often asked several questions about the Alpha Vampire. One is not so much a question, but people want to tell me how they feel about the character. Complete strangers have come up to me and said, “I hate that they killed you off on Supernatural. I wanted you to be the Big Bad for the season.” I always reply, “Hey, it’s out of my hands, but at least he died the way I wanted him to die—with honor.” That leads to the next question, which is: “What did the Alpha Vampire want?”</p><p class="calibre_1">Everyone has very passionate feelings about the show and the characters, and this is my own interpretation of what the Alpha Vampire wants. He wants someone to beat him. He wants an honorable death, because he’s essentially been walking around for at least 200,000 years unbeatable. Literally no one—living or dead—had been able to best him. He is the king of the monsters—untouchable. You can’t beat him physically, but he can be outsmarted. And I think that’s really what he was looking for—someone who could think a move or two ahead of him like it was a game of chess. Someone who could outsmart him and make a winning move. And that was Sam Winchester. It had to be.</p><p class="calibre_1">I love the thing that Sam does with the bullet as they distract the Alpha Vampire at the Men of Letters command center. Sam puts the killing bullet inside the Colt.</p><p class="calibre_1">The Alpha Vampire says, “There are only five creatures on this earth that gun cannot kill—and I’m one of them.”</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s a huge power play between the two of them, and it’s like, who’s bluffing and who isn’t?</p><p class="calibre_1">And then Sam says: “Are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre_1">I’m getting chills right now remembering the scene. I love that it’s filmed in slow motion. Sam pulls the trigger and that bullet comes out, so slowly, directly toward the Alpha Vampire’s forehead. And there’s that little smile on the Alpha Vampire’s face, and he says to Sam, “Clever, clever boy.”</p><p class="calibre_1">And then BAM!—that bullet comes out and it goes right through the Alpha Vampire’s head. He doesn’t dodge the bullet (although people have said that he could have), but maybe he didn’t want to. The bullet goes right through his head, and there’s that little smile. If I were to write what he was thinking right then, it would have been, “Well done, Sam, well done.”</p><p class="calibre_1">And then BOOM!—he’s gone.</p><p class="calibre_1">An honorable death.</p><p class="calibre_1">This character, and this show, have meant a lot to me. We have the best fandom, literally, in the entire world. You can go anywhere in the world and if you see someone wearing a Supernatural shirt or you go to a convention anywhere, you find instant family and friends. I absolutely love that. I’ve been to Italy, Germany, London, Australia, so many places—for conventions or maybe just walking through the airport—and I see someone with a Supernatural shirt on or someone recognizes me from the show, and you exchange Instagram accounts and you’ve made a new friend. It’s the most incredible, most dysfunctional family in the whole world, and I’m really happy and proud to be a part of it.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_54"></div>
