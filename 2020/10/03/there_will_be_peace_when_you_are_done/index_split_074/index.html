</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><span class="italic">(in collaboration with and derived from an interview with Lynn Zubernis)</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">One of the most fascinating and compelling things about being an actor on Supernatural has been discovering the SPNFamily and the global community that has evolved and grown around the show. I said early on in my convention Q &amp; A panels that meeting members of the SPNFamily (whom I have now affectionately nicknamed “The Cousins”) was like entering a clearing in the jungle and finding this amazing, quirky, wonderful artistic tribe. I continue to be amazed by the intellectualism, the artistry, and the enthusiasm, as well as the support for creative works and the role of storytelling in the show. Every time I’ve been with a “cousin” face to face (the word “fan” purposefully avoided here), it has been an extremely warm, pleasant, and dare I say loving interaction. “Face to face” is emphasized since I believe these interactions to be the truest forms of human communion. They are the most rewarding for me. I truly enjoy making eye contact, reading body language, and listening to the nuances of intonation in the voice: a humanist’s and actor’s craft and trade. Online engagement via Twitter and Instagram has been more challenging. It can be a lot of work and has been a learning curve for me, albeit MOSTLY positive; however, small minorities and cabals seeking “Chuck-knows-what” have been greatly illustrative of the dark cultural trends we are navigating as a society.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00021.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_25">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I’m often asked if I’m a fan of the show. Here’s where I get a little nerdy, semantic, and etymological. I have an aversion to the word fan due to it being the shortened derivation of fanatic. To me that insinuates the turning off of one’s logical brain. I like to think of fans as fellow enthusiasts instead. I prefer the word enthusiast since fanatic has a religious or dogmatic connotation or, at the very least, the implication that one is accepting things at face value or without question. So when asked, I clarify that, yes, I am a big ENTHUSIAST of the show!</p><p class="calibre_1">I have very eclectic tastes. I’m an enthusiast of many artists and art forms. For example, as a boy, I was a big Star Wars enthusiast, and then Star Trek. And no, don’t ask me to choose! Both can exist in my brain and heart congruently. I guess you could say I have a reasonable amount of “Nerd cred.” I say “Nerd” with a capital N proudly as those have always been my people. I certainly don’t want to label the Supernatural viewers as “Nerds” (that is an individual’s choice;)). BUT I think my love and understanding of like-minded folks gives me good rapport with many in this community.</p><p class="calibre_1">I was flattered, humbled, and nervous when I was first invited to do the Supernatural conventions. At the end of the day, the overriding emotion was pure excitement to go and have this profoundly unique experience that no one can quite prepare you for. Some of the other actors from the show (and others from Battlestar Galactica and Stargate Atlantis) talked to me about what to expect from con life. It was the King of Cons himself, Richard Speight, Jr. (who plays Gabriel), who gave me the best coaching and encouragement. He said, “Oh, you’re a theater and comedy guy and a storyteller, you’ll do just fine.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Still, I wasn’t expecting the incredibly gracious and warm welcome I received. There was this moment when I truly understood the power of the show, the power of my role, and the power of television and media to affect people. My first ALL Supernatural convention was in San Francisco, and the audience all played kazoos at me after Louden Swain’s “Medicated,” which took my con premiere to a whole new level. What a wild welcome!</p><p class="calibre_1">But the outpouring of attention and enthusiasm for my role on the show would soon be eclipsed by something far greater. The best thing to come from the SPNFamily and Supernatural for me was the opportunity to do some good works in the world. I want to give full credit to Misha Collins for paving the way as the innovator and leader of the community in our charitable efforts. What is so rewarding about this experience is that it’s something I never would have chosen to do on my own. The Less Than Three campaign came out of the social interactions and conversations I had with people online who were following me, in a completely organic way. In fact, it came about as a misunderstanding because I was so new to social media that I didn’t know that &lt;3 was a heart. I thought, Oh I get it, I’m being trolled. I’m being graded on the Jared and Jensen scale, who are obviously tens, so I’m less than three. And I thought, That’s kind of harsh! The other thing I thought (if I’m totally honest) is that it might mean they’re farting at me, that maybe it’s supposed to represent flatulence directed at my stupid face. Are they giving me the virtual raspberry because they don’t like me? Am I not welcome here?</p><p class="calibre_1">I expected blowback when I began playing a character like Ketch. When Ketch first came on the scene, there were some actual personal attacks directed at me on social media that I can only deduce were because of the whole character versus actor thing, the bleed if you will. It’s also very possible people didn’t like my acting or the way I looked. That comes with the territory of putting yourself and your work out there publicly. But I mean, these people certainly didn’t know me in REAL life. That level of anonymous attack was shocking to me, though I hear it all the time with soap opera actors or others who play “villains.” They get a lot of grief in their personal and online lives for the characters they play. That’s a hard thing to wrap your head around, especially if you’re a sensitive person, as actors often are. Like, wait a minute, why do you hate me? I’m not that person, that’s my job! Often the biggest sweethearts are the ones who make the best villains because there’s some vengeance in their own background that they want to play out . . . but I digress, that’s a whole other psychological thing better serviced in therapy.;)</p><p class="calibre_1">So, back to the evolution of my charitable efforts. People following me on social media promptly corrected me on the &lt;3 meaning. Case in point, a wonderful woman named Ingrid told me, “Well, that’s funny because me and my partner say we ‘less than three’ each other.” To which I replied, “That’s wonderful, can we use that?” This led the community of my mates to start saying, “I less than three you,” which was then abbreviated into LTTU. Eventually the community demanded, “Well, what are you going to do for YOUR charity?” I was like, “What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I don’t have a charity.” But they persisted, saying, “This fandom will get behind your charity, so what’s your cause?” Well, in that moment I knew I had to try to do something deeply personal and authentic. My Nana, who had suffered for over a decade with Alzheimer’s disease, and my hero Grandad, a WWII veteran and her selfless caregiver, would be the inspiration and posthumous honorees of my efforts.</p><p class="calibre_1">Charity campaign and merchandise vendor Represent had also previously contacted me, suggesting that I do something with them, knowing that the Supernatural fandom was so engaged. So I created and designed the &lt;3 = LOVE (LTTU) campaign for Alzheimer’s organizations, particularly the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA). I dusted off the architecture-trained design part of my brain, my passion for equal rights for all humans, and my spiritual mantra that “love is love and God and goodness are love,” et voila! That’s how the campaign came about: Through a conversation derived and inspired directly by the “FAM-DOM” (a term Matt Cohen, who played young John Winchester, so brilliantly coined). It was incredible, meaningful, and very humbling; a creative, giving-back journey that I would have never done if it were not for this community of people.</p><p class="calibre_1">The personal relationships that I’ve made are the other important thing I’ll take from Supernatural. There’s real camaraderie among the cast and such kind leadership from the top (read: J2M). Everyone is great at their jobs, and there are lots of jokes, lots of joy, and of course lots of gratitude for being there at the conventions. Obviously, Adam Fergus (who plays Mick Davies) and I really cemented our friendship playing the duo we are—we’ve been told we’re like the low-rent version of Rob and Rich on Kings of Con. I’ll take it, haha! We have genuine chemistry. In fact, I think people can sense how much we really enjoy each other’s company, so that’s been wonderful. Even though we didn’t have many scenes together on the show, people sometimes think that Ketch and Mick must have been friends. I think that’s just the influence of our playful camaraderie on stage.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’ve been asked if I think Ketch will leave a legacy behind, but right now, that’s tough to say. That word legacy is a dodgy one for me and a concept for the audience to ultimately determine. I think it’s like taste in art or wine—everyone’s palate is going to be different. I think legacy is something that builds over time, over two years or five years or twenty years, so we’ll eventually see what the audience is still saying (if anything) about this character. Personally, I like his journey (I’m biased of course). He went from an automaton-esque assassin to a more independent thinking, non-dogmatic individual. In Supernatural language, he learned how to become Team Free Will right before his dramatic demise. I love the poetry of Ketch giving his heart for the Winchesters. It’s terrible and it’s moving and I had so many people come up to me after Ketch’s death to say that it was too soon and too sad. They wondered aloud how we, the collaborative creators, made them cry about arguably one of the most despised characters on the show.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural itself is unique in so many ways. The Supernatural set is a completely different place to work than most sets, and that culture always comes from the top. I know that Jared and Jensen have talked about how the wonderful producer Kim Manners sat them down in the early seasons when they were on the cusp. From what Jensen and Jared have said to me and to others publicly, the general gist and the paraphrased take-away lesson for me was this: “We can do this ego-wise or we can do this family-wise. And if you do this family-wise, we may be able to have a nice long run. But if we start getting into the weeds and make this about ego, it’s going to be a problem—so you guys decide.” From my understanding, that’s when the brotherhood truly cemented. J2 obviously had great chemistry already, as everyone knows, but I think that it’s also true for the thirty- or forty-plus crew members and staff members who have been there since day one. The set of Supernatural is a family. People do not stay on television shows if they’re not having a rewarding time. There are always going to be long days and hard nights and grumpiness and what have you, but at the end of the day, there’s a lot of laughter and a lot of caring. I guess collegiality would be the best way to characterize the set—not a frat house, but a make-believe fun house. Welcome to the World of Supernatural. We’re professional pretenders; welcome to the party.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">Jared and Jensen immediately welcomed me as I’ve seen them welcome other guests so generously. And that kindness goes a long way when you’re a guest going into someone else’s home. To be welcomed with such open arms and with such enthusiasm makes a huge difference. I’ll never forget that first day when I met Jared and Jensen. They were so generous. They wanted to know who I was as a person, where I was from. They instantly made me feel welcome.</p><p class="calibre_1">In season 14, when I returned for that small cameo, Jared and I were at craft services late at night and he said, “It’s so good to see you back here, man.” We were geeking out with each other, going really academic and analyzing language and etymology and literature, doing a deep dive together. That night I asked him, “What’s the secret? Why is everyone, to a person, so great on this show?” And he said, “I don’t know, man. It comes from casting and the producers. We’ve been so lucky in fifteen seasons to have only a few problematic actors in terms of day players, and even that didn’t really cause drama.” That level of evenness and consistency is incredible for a television show.</p><p class="calibre_1">I enjoyed working with Jensen so much as well. He and I got along wonderfully, and he’s been so kind, collaborative, and generous to me. I loved to play around in our scenes together. There was a lot of laughter, but we also knew our roles in terms of that odd couple relationship that Dean and Ketch had.</p><p class="calibre_1">My experience on the show has been so positive in terms of integration and collaboration. Obviously, that’s the light that Jared and Jensen radiate and that they get shone back at them. It’s quite extraordinary, because there are a lot of horror stories out there about toxic sets. To be fair, I should knock on wood because it’s probably coming for me, because everyone has that one story, the horror show, the problems with egos. This show is not that; it’s the absolute opposite. That’s why a lot of actors say they’re going to miss Supernatural so much. It’s not just missing the character you play; it’s also missing going to work in that environment. When you have a place like that to go act and those kinds of people to play with, that makes all the difference. In any field. I’ve often said that I’d rather have a shitty job where I LIKE THE PEOPLE than a great job where I can’t abide the people. With Supernatural, you get the great job and the great people.</p><p class="calibre_1">I think that the legacy that Supernatural leaves behind will rival a show like Star Trek, which has such a huge canon and lore as well as a wonderful ability to explore and retool traditional storytelling and then make it unique. I thought that was quite brilliant for Supernatural as well, but there’s also just a record-breaking amount of television that the show has created. That doesn’t happen in the world of television anymore. We’ve already seen the legacy continue in young people streaming it—a new generation of young teens absolutely gobbling it up. And then mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers—three generations are watching Supernatural together now because of streaming. That proves what Eric Kripke and the subsequent writers did was to really know their archetypes and hero’s journey. When you then add more mythic lore and spin it on its pop culture ear, you make something that’s truly tasty for an audience to devour—both young and old, female and male, non-binary and genderqueer, disabled and abled, and every self-identifying human on the wonderful spectrum that wants to be included. That’s what makes the show popular—we can all find something to latch on to.</p><p class="calibre_1">And again, we come back to family. The truly extraordinary, unique, inclusive SPNFamily.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_76"></div>
