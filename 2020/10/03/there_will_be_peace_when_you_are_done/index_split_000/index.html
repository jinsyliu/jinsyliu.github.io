In a way, that descriptor is perfect for this show, though, because like its characters, it has been quietly doing important work—unknowingly to many, but life-changing for the special group whose lives have been directly touched by Dean and Sam Winchester and their friends. Using stories from those who worked on the show, including Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Davy Perez, as well as those extended #SPNFamily members who have been touched and inspired by the show, There’ll Be Peace When You Are Done poignantly and poetically captures the bigger legacy of Supernatural. For 40-odd minutes a week, it was about hunting, but, as this volume of unabashedly honest and open essays proves, for 24/7, 365 it has been about saving people.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">—Danielle Turchiano, senior features editor at Variety</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">“Supernatural represents an extraordinarily special moment in pop culture history and in this moving, thoughtful and beautifully curated collection, Lynn Zubernis has perfectly captured being a part of such a wild—and inimitable—ride. The Winchesters’ greatest accomplishment (outside of saving the world a few times) is definitely the #SPNFamily, and the beating heart of the fandom and the good works it has inspired live in the pages of There’ll Be Peace When You Are Done. I can’t think of a better tribute or testament to a show that has meant so much to so many than this wonderful book.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">—Courtney Summers, New York Times bestselling author of Sadie</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_1"></div>
