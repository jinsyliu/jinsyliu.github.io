</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">When my agent called with an offer from producer Jeremy Carver for a three-episode arc on Supernatural , I was flattered and honored. Jeremy’s wife, Anna Frike, had been a writer on Men in Trees , a series I had done four years prior, and Jeremy apparently liked my work on that show.</p><p class="calibre_1">But I was in a dilemma. I was already committed to appear in a friend’s independent film, and was scheduled to fly to Hawaii the following week, the same time I would have to film Supernatural. My Catholic guilt kicked in. Usually my guilt costs me, on average, three nights of lost sleep.</p><p class="calibre_1">But once I realized that the role of Linda Tran afforded me the opportunity to play the first badass character of my career, my decision became clear. At 5 feet tall and 99 pounds, a badass role had never presented itself to me before. Most folks remembered me as the painfully shy Lena in The Joy Luck Club or the perennially nice Julie in the sitcom Friends.</p><p class="calibre_1">Perhaps unconsciously, I was longing to get back to the badass, independent girl I used to be when I was a small child. I grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, a quiet, affluent suburb north of Chicago. I imagine my life must have looked idyllic from the outside. But with the triple whammy of being raised Catholic in a town that was 98 percent Jewish, being a member of the only Chinese American family in my town, and being raised in an Asian culture that valued politeness and congeniality, by the time I entered middle school I had become an extremely lonely, shy outsider without a voice.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00041.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_29">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Apparently, it wasn’t always that way. From what I’m told, between ages one through eight, I was a hell-raiser who garnered the nickname “Little Tiger” from my maternal grandfather, Da-En. My mom tells me I insisted on doing all my own stunts as a toddler, allowing grown-ups to hold my hand going down the stairs, but then climbing right back up and coming down again on my own. And lunchtime was always a search-and-rescue mission for my mom, as she allowed me to walk the half mile home from school. Day after day, the school would call to tell her that I hadn’t returned back to school after lunch. So she would jump in her car and start looking for me. She usually found me sitting in the dirt on a wooded path engrossed in the rocks I had found. (As a mother today, I can’t imagine letting my kids walk to and from school at six years old, but those were different times, I suppose.)</p><p class="calibre_1">Da-En and my mom would watch me orchestrate games with all the kids on my block, allocating who would play which part. The outcomes of these games always ended up with me as the winner. “Beauty Pageant” was a favorite game, where I assigned the kids I didn’t like so much to represent countries I also didn’t like very much.</p><p class="calibre_1">But even with all of this bossy behavior, my grandfather still thought I was a good kid, and used to pay me a dollar for banging out songs on the piano for him as he took a nap in the Barcalounger. He and my grandmother visited our family every weekend, and that helped solidify my strong character, which surprised no one, as I came from a long line of strong women.</p><p class="calibre_1">My grandmother, Helen, and Da-En had emigrated from China to the United States in 1918. Helen longed to go to school and get an education, but at that time, in her small village of Hoi Ping, only boys were allowed to attend school. Undeterred, she sat on the ground outside the classroom and listened to the lessons. She vowed to one day right this inequality and assigned herself this task. She and my grandfather bought a small takeout restaurant in a blue-collar community in Chicago, which they eventually built up into a sit-down restaurant called Dang Ho. They worked this business together for fifty-five years, and unbeknownst to anyone, Helen had been secretly stashing away money for her dream. In 1987, she sent that money back to Hoi Ping and had a school built where both boys and girls were allowed to attend. I traveled with her to China for the grand opening. It was the proudest moment of my life.</p><p class="calibre_1">And her daughter, my mother, Nancy, was also a spitfire who was and still remains an activist and ardent supporter of Asian causes. In 2011, President Obama gave her a “Champion of Change” award at the White House, and again, I was there to witness that great honor.</p><p class="calibre_1">So as a child, it made perfect sense that I would take up the mantle as “Little Tiger.” In fact, I became a fierce protector of my friend Terri, who lived near us and had suffered a terrible tragedy. Terri had been in a plane crash when she was two, which killed her mother and sister and left her half deaf and paralyzed on the left side of her body. My mother forced me to play with her, which I wasn’t too happy about at first, but I soon came to enjoy Terri’s company quite a bit. She always happily let me make her be “Miss Poland” and with a ton of grace accepted the position of perennial runner-up in every pageant. We still laugh about it to this day.</p><p class="calibre_1">But when Terri and I entered middle school together, everything seemed to change, and I began to morph into someone I didn’t recognize. We were teased mercilessly by some particularly mean kids—her for being a “gimp,” and me for being a “chink.” I thought to myself, “Chink!?” I wasn’t sure what they meant at first. I thought I was a white Jewish girl like everyone else. But when they started singing “Ching Chong Chinaman” as they pulled their eyes back into slits, I soon caught the drift. Those daily taunts cut me to the core and filled me with rage, but I couldn’t find the courage to fight back or advocate for myself. But when it came to Terri, I somehow managed to yell to those bullies, “Leave her alone, you jerks!” Those words didn’t stop them, of course, and no one else came to our defense. But I do remember one girl suggesting to me that if I dropped Terri as a friend, I would most likely not get bullied as badly myself. That didn’t seem like the right thing to do, and it’s not how my mother raised me. So I stuck by Terri and defended her always. Looking back, I see now that this was training for my role as Linda Tran—to protect my son, Kevin (played by Osric Chau), at all costs.</p><p class="calibre_1">Miraculously, when I turned thirteen, I fell in love with dance. I poured my heart, my soul, and all that negative energy into training four hours a day. Mostly because I loved it, but also to escape the torture that was high school. Dance was my saving grace and was the portal from which I entered the entertainment field. When I was seventeen, the national tour of the Broadway show A Chorus Line came through Chicago. I was encouraged by some girls in my dance class to audition, as there was a part of a tiny Chinese girl in the musical who sings about being really short and looking very young. I didn’t know how to act or sing, and was extremely shy, but my mother drove me to the audition anyway. I remember clutching the edge of the piano on the side of the stage, looking down, and singing in a horribly meek off-key voice, “If My Friends Could See Me Now” from Sweet Charity. The director asked me to move to the center of the stage and start again. Without the security of hanging on to the piano, I felt like I had no clothes on as I inched my way to center stage like a “dead man walking.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Even though I clearly couldn’t act or sing, my dancing skills got me hired for the role. I am grateful to this day that I was given this chance, as it set me on the path I’ve been walking for the past four decades.</p><p class="calibre_1">Over the years (and lots of therapy!), I’ve gradually come closer to feeling like that brave, strong little girl I once was, which was why it was so important to me to portray Linda Tran on Supernatural. And although I still feel like a misfit and an outsider at times, I realize now that most people probably feel that way—our situations and particular details might be different, but we, as humans, are all much more alike than different.</p><p class="calibre_1">Perhaps that’s what has bound the Supernatural family so close together. We are all—fans, crew, and cast—a bunch of bighearted misfits who have come together around a show that we all love. At the end of the day, we all long for that sense of belonging; we are social animals, after all. And I have nothing but gratitude for the love and support that the Supernatural Family has shown me through social media and meeting face to face at conventions.</p><p class="calibre_1">Thank you for reading part of my story. I hope to hear yours someday. And with that, I will end my chapter with a wish for you. It’s the same wish I hold for my kids, and that is: May you truly know that You Are Enough. That is a given. From there, find something you really love to do, get behind that, and push with all you’ve got. Channel any negative energy inside you into something positive that you can share and contribute to the world. And here’s a quote from best-selling author Brené Brown that seems appropriate to end with: “You either walk inside your story and own it, or you stand outside your story and hustle for your worthiness.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>
