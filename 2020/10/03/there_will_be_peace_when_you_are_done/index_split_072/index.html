If you had told us we’d be in year four of a multiyear research project that explores fandom-based activism, after building an academic partnership across state lines (over a tweet by Misha Collins), we would have stared at you with open disbelief. But life often takes us down paths we least expect, right when we most need to diverge from “the road so far.”</p><p class="calibre_1">From staffing mental health crisis hotlines to participating in disaster relief efforts, Supernatural fans have made Dean Winchester’s rallying cry of “saving people” a reality. Despite critiques that the show disproportionately kills off women characters and repeatedly fails the Bechdel test (whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man), the fan base and its charitable efforts are largely made up of fans who identify as women. This is not a coincidence, as factors unique to Supernatural have created an empowering environment for women, even though women have not consistently been represented in an equitable way on-screen.</p><p class="calibre_1">The longevity of the show and fan engagement via social media have enabled a public sphere where fans can actually lobby for more inclusive representation with respect to gender identity, racial-ethnic diversity, ability status, and LGBTQ identity. The Supernatural fandom has created spaces where participation in fannish activity is encouraged rather than stigmatized, in which fannish identity includes expectations of doing charitable work, feminist leadership is possible, and women feel safe and valued for their own sake. From charitable fundraising at conventions to the Wayward Daughters movement, social engagement in Supernatural fan spaces mirrors social movement–style activism and is arguably the most impactful and important legacy of the show. This essay explores the social activism of Supernatural fans with respect to expressing desire for more women-focused, intersectional representation on the show and to charitable initiatives grounded in the fandom that have led to the creation of nonprofit organizations.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">KAELA’S STORY</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I discovered the Supernatural fandom at a very precarious time in my life. I was in the later years of a graduate program in clinical psychology, applying for internships in a market where there were not enough accredited positions to go around. I stumbled upon reruns of the show one morning before a meeting with my academic advisor and was immediately hooked. Watching the show became my much-needed relaxation ritual, and conventions eventually became my grounding space over many years of professional rejection before my career took off.</p><p class="calibre_1">Throughout my life, I’ve had a tendency to dive passionately into areas of interest, including sci-fi and horror franchises, but until I started watching Supernatural, I had never really made the leap to attending fan culture conventions—likely because I didn’t know anyone else who did. Attending Supernatural fan conventions in my late twenties and early thirties, however, changed my life. Convention spaces became somewhere I could challenge negative beliefs about my professional setbacks (and myself in general) by communing with other women in shameless obsession over a shared love.</p><p class="calibre_1">As a psychologist who specializes in working with gender and sexual minority (GSM) communities, I am trained to help others heal from shame by teaching them to develop a different relationship with painful self-talk, often by encouraging them to engage in communities of like-minded folks. As a researcher, I couldn’t help but wonder what it was about Supernatural and other fan culture spaces that fostered the particular type of community that I was experiencing firsthand—a community that felt much like a family, that (mostly) unconditionally had my back, and that was incredibly active in mental health charity and activism. Then, I found Tanya, whose presentation on the Supernatural fandom at an academic meeting had been noticed and tweeted by Misha Collins.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">TANYA’S STORY</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">My entry into the Supernatural fandom started like many others; a friend who had similar taste in pop culture recommended the show and I thought, Okay, I’ll give it a try. I admit, I was not an instant convert. I’ve never been much of a horror fan, but as a lover of most things sci-fi and urban fantasy, I knew I had to give it a try. I was not instantly hooked, but by the season 1 episode “Faith,” I realized I was all in. I watched nine seasons of Supernatural in two months despite having a full-time job and a full-time family. (We may have eaten a lot of frozen pizzas that spring, sorry fam.) A year and a half later, I attended my first Supernatural convention, started cosplaying as Jody Mills, and was on the cusp of undertaking the biggest academic research project of my career.</p><p class="calibre_1">Despite being a lifelong geek, I grew up in the 1980s in rural Wisconsin and didn’t have much exposure to fan culture or conventions. But all that changed when I fell into the Supernatural fandom. When I started watching, I was fortunate enough to live in Denver, a large enough city to host frequent comic conventions and geek meetups, and more importantly, the INTERNET existed. In 2014, on a whim, I signed up for GISHWHES, Misha Collins’s charity scavenger hunt. That experience exposed me to a side of fandom I quickly became obsessed with: the participatory, charitable, social-good-focused activities I saw fans engaged in. As a sociologist, I’m trained to notice patterns. I soon realized that while Supernatural was not the only fandom doing good, there were interesting and unique things happening that led me to consider how fandom-based charity work parallels what some scholars call “consensus” social movements. As Kaela mentioned, we found each other online after Misha retweeted an abstract of a talk I presented and used it to troll costar Jared Padalecki about starting a cult. So, I guess, like a lot of people who end up doing unexpected things because of this fandom, you could say this is all Misha’s fault.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00012.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_25">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">HARNESSING THE POWER OF FANDOM FOR SOCIAL GOOD</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">This turn toward social movement–style activism that we both discovered is a crucial and important piece of Supernatural’s legacy. Typically, we think of social movements as large, sustained efforts involving multiple organizations and stakeholders that advocate for political or social change. Classic examples include the civil rights movement, the feminist movement, and the LGBTQ rights movement. More recent examples like Black Lives Matter and the Youth Climate Strike focus their efforts on changing political structures, corporate practices, and cultures as a whole. When we talk about our work, we often receive the critical comment that fan action is not political, just charity work, or what is called a consensus movement—a type of action no reasonable person would disagree with.</p><p class="calibre_1">All of these critiques attempt to draw boundaries that construct some as “real” activists and others as merely “online” activists, implying that online activism is lacking in value as an agent of change by its own right.² Evidence suggests, however, that online activism does, in fact, translate to in-person action, and can create a sense of visibility and community.³ Historically, these critiques tend to line up with gendered devaluing of the action of women-identified people. In other words, the kinds of action and activism that women do disproportionately are socially constructed as less valuable and not true (radical) activism. The irony here is that online spaces may be particularly appealing to women and other marginalized groups precisely due to this devaluation, as online spaces are increasingly more accessible and can allow for women to recontextualize what it means to be an activist.⁴ When women and other marginalized groups are excluded from public participation in politics, they join together where they do have power.</p><p class="calibre_1">Although much of the action and efforts in the Supernatural fandom are focused on charity work and relief efforts, fans have shown that kindness can be revolutionary. While no one may disagree that feeding hungry children or working to prevent suicide is important, the idea of creating an organized group of people with sustained resources and a space to dialogue about values and priorities is qualitatively different. Through their efforts to create sustained awareness about social problems, including poverty, hunger, the effects of war and genocide, and mental health issues, fans are creating a culture of engagement. This culture of engagement, in and of itself, can bring power to social movements, particularly the empowerment of women activists, in a landscape where women’s power is otherwise restricted or challenged.</p><p class="calibre_1">As previously discussed, when women and other marginalized groups are excluded from public participation in politics, they join together where they do have power. Prior to the internet, those spaces have been things like gender-specific volunteer groups, sewing and crafting circles, and churches. Modern fandom contains a similar potential activist space, and this is why so many charitable initiatives are morphing into social movement–style activism. Fans who may not feel connected to or empowered by “proper channels” of civic engagement tap into opportunities through their networked position in fandom. Some fans are increasingly self-defining their fan identity as one that carries participatory, behavioral expectations. In other words, thinking of myself as a Supernatural fan may lead me to be more inclined to try to do things that “save people.” But before we focus on SPN fans’ charitable action, let’s take another brief moment to consider how women’s participation in fandom has traditionally been understood.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">WOMEN’S PARTICIPATION IN FANDOM</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Until recently, science fiction, fantasy, and pop culture fans who identify as women have either been overlooked as vital contributors to fan culture or harshly judged for what the media and broader society defined as overzealous behavior.⁵ Coverage of Beatlemania in the 1960s was permeated with language pathologizing women fans that is sexist at best and misogynistic at worst, from a modern perspective.⁶ Interestingly, fans of sports who identify as men and are just as zealous largely escaped the media’s armchair psychoanalysis in this time period. Despite the stereotype that sci-fi fans are mostly men, it was famously women who organized one of the first and most oft-cited instances of fan activism, the letter-writing campaign to NBC that saved Star Trek: The Original Series from cancellation.⁷ And it was also women who organized and started the first Star Trek conventions. Prior to the internet and social media fan sites, many women organized distribution lists of fan works and fan creative content via snail mail and later email.</p><p class="calibre_1">Given this history of women’s involvement in sci-fi fandom and fan activism, perhaps it is not that surprising that Supernatural would attract a large, passionate following of disproportionately women-identified fans. Many might claim that women watch the show largely to ogle the handsome male leads, but we argue that the show’s main themes speak disproportionately to those who have experienced marginalization, such as those socialized as women and those who identify as LGBTQ. To paraphrase our friend Riley Santangelo of Wayward Daughters, fandom is a place that those who have experienced outsider status can come together and feel included. After all, who are bigger outsiders than Sam, Dean, and Castiel? Team Free Will chose lives of constant struggle and marginalization in order to serve humanity. The idea of giving up one’s individual priorities in service to family and community is something many women can identify with. Bobby Singer’s famous dictum “family don’t end with blood” spoke to all of us who have found support and solidarity in created kinship and families of choice.</p><p class="calibre_1">In addition to identifying with themes of the show, Supernatural fans found meaning and created relationships through in-person interactions with one another and the stars of the show at Supernatural conventions. Supernatural’s historic fifteen-season run and availability on Netflix fostered multiple generations of fans. Current fans of the show may have even been born after the series premiere! An uptick in fan engagement online via social media sites and the technological diffusion of smart-phones from 2007 to the present also coincided with the show’s run. Add to this Misha Collins’s subversive and strategic use of Twitter, and you have the spark that lit the powder keg of collective, kinetic, emotional energy that has fueled fans’ charitable work and civic engagement. Conventions, fan engagement online, and celebrity participation have created a fandom mobilized for social activism.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">OUT OF THE FRIDGE</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Despite the gap between the intended audience for Supernatural—the eighteen- to thirty-five-year-old male—and the actual audience of Supernatural, disproportionately women of all ages, the show suffered from a dearth of women characters. One of the consistent critiques of the show has been its “fridging” of women characters, a term for character deaths that are premature to a woman’s character arc and serve only to further the story line of male protagonists. In season 1, both Mary Winchester and Sam’s girlfriend, Jessica, are introduced with little to no character development before being killed by the Yellow-Eyed Demon to set the boys on their quests of “saving people” and “hunting things.” Thus, the main women characters in the show served as little more than motivation for the boys’ multiyear hunting road trip. Other early attempts to incorporate more women characters, such as Ellen and Jo in season 2, were divisive in the fandom, with fans either loving or hating them. By the time fan favorites Charlie Bradbury (played by Felicia Day) and Jody Mills (played by Kim Rhodes) were introduced, however, the fandom itself had changed in important ways.</p><p class="calibre_1">One important variable that could help explain the different reaction to Jody and Charlie versus Ellen and Jo is the rise of social media and the ability for fans to speak directly to TPTB. When Supernatural first started, Facebook was in its infancy and Twitter did not exist. Misha Collins joined Twitter in 2009 and Kim Rhodes joined in 2011. By the time more well-developed characters like Charlie and Jody debuted on the show, fans could dialogue directly with their new favorites. Dialogues that started at conventions between fans and content creators/producers continued online, cementing relationship ties and ultimately leading to a large, diffuse social network. This network became a self-sustaining community among fans, eventually called the “SPNFamily.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">THE POWER OF SOCIAL NETWORKS</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Sociologist Mark Granovetter wrote about the power of social networks in fostering collective action and organization in 1973, long before the social media interconnectedness that is common today. Intriguingly, he claimed it was not the direct relationships between friends who knew each other well that contained the most potential, but the relationships possible by third- and fourth-order connections, a phenomenon he called “the strength of weak ties.” Basically, you could call this the “I know a person who knows a person” phenomenon. Fandom-based connections provide a networked hub of individuals who can be mobilized quickly when pointed toward a common goal. Thus, when Misha Collins asked fans via Twitter to donate to UNICEF, fans raised over $30,000. This eventually led to the creation of a nonprofit organization, Random Acts, which has raised millions for various charitable initiatives to date, and is the main beneficiary of the GISH scavenger hunt.</p><p class="calibre_1">If you think about the ways GISHers rely on their team and broader network connections to accomplish multiple seemingly impossible feats in less than a week, you can easily see Granovetter’s point. In 2016, GISHers raised $215,000 to help four Syrian refugee families find more stable, permanent housing. The following years, the “Change a Life Item” called on GISHers to harness their social networks to fundraise for a dance school in South Africa, to purchase farming land in support of survivors of Rwandan genocide, and to remove unexploded ordnances (land mines) from the Vietnam War in Laos. From local food and feminine hygiene product supply drives at conventions and a grant for school-based projects to ongoing funding for the Jacmel Children’s Center in Haiti and the Free School for women and girls in Nicaragua, fans are making a lasting impact in improving the lives of others and future generations through direct action and donations.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural fandom was also innovative in developing the main fundraising method for many of these charitable initiatives. Online retailer “Stands,” created in 2015, partners with actors from Supernatural and other shows to design and sell everything from exclusive t-shirts to teddy bears. In collaboration with Wayward Daughters and subsequent Wayward merchandising campaigns, Kim Rhodes and Briana Buckmaster raised money for a nonprofit called New Leash On Life, which matches shelter dogs with incarcerated people who then train the dogs to be service animals. When many fans expressed desire for merchandise from these campaigns but did not have the means to purchase the items, Wayward Daughters and Stands initiated a donor matching campaign to help.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">In addition to charitable action through Random Acts, fans have organized their own responses to urgent issues. After Hurricane Harvey in 2017, hundreds of fans joined Crowd Rescue HQ efforts. Working with the Cajun navy and first responders, a group of Supernatural fans called “SPN Rescue” monitored SOS posts online and helped connect people trapped by the floodwaters with rescue services. Estimates of the number of people and animals rescued through these efforts vary, but rescue totals are estimated at 29,000 people and over 600 animals. Fandom-based volunteers we spoke with approximated that they directly helped with the rescue or evacuation of 700 to 1,000 individuals. One individual we interviewed stated that 30 to 40 percent of the online volunteers were Supernatural fans. SPN Rescue volunteers we spoke with described ten- and twelve-hour shifts of monitoring or “scrubbing” social media for hashtags including #SOSHarvey and #SOSHouston. Many volunteers experienced personal trauma because of their efforts. One volunteer related the following: “The most difficult call I had was talking to someone while her roommate was drowning.” The “strength of weak” fandom ties were used in this disaster response as well. One fan mentioned relying on the international members of the fan base and coordination via Slack chat rooms. As she put it, “I’d be logging off and [Name] (in Sweden) or [Name] (in the UK) would be ready to take over.”</p><p class="calibre_1">One of the more unique volunteer efforts by Supernatural fans has been the SPNFamily Crisis Support Network, a social network in the form of Supernatural fans trained as mental health crisis hotline responders to assist other fans in times of need. The model for this crisis line is one of peer support, not unlike peer-led crisis hotlines that exist for LGBTQ communities, such as the Trevor Project and Trans Lifeline. While the crisis support network was launched initially by actors Misha Collins and Jensen Ackles in 2016, it was largely born out of fans sharing their personal struggles with mental health in convention spaces—fans who are more likely to have been women.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">THE FAMILY WE CHOOSE</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">So, why is peer support important? It comes down to family—in this case, chosen family. The concept of chosen family, otherwise known academically as “fictive kin,” is the family that “don’t end in blood,” kinships outside bloodlines or marriage, the social networks we create for ourselves. The word family is quite literally in the name of the SPNFamily Crisis Support Network, and is a term often used throughout the fandom to describe the ties that bind us. We are, to one another, fictive kin. This becomes important for those experiencing mental health crises, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds. In research on LGBTQ populations, for example, support by family and others has been shown to mediate suicide risk, while family rejection and victimization have been shown to increase risk.⁸,⁹ Chosen family can act as the protective factor one needs to get through periods of crisis.</p><p class="calibre_1">We see this with other types of peer support, such as military veteran peer support programs like Vets4Vets, where research has demonstrated that increased perception of peer support decreases mental health symptoms. While we don’t know the full impact of the SPNFamily Crisis Support Network at this point in time, we know, at least anecdotally, that it is having the intended effect.</p><p class="calibre_1">While the crisis support network may have gained the most press, it’s not the only mental health nonprofit that has been born out of the fandom. SPN Survivors, founded by David and Karla Truxall, is another organization that promotes mental health and suicide prevention through fundraising, education, and awareness campaigns, including information on valuable resources for survivors of suicide. Members of the SPN fandom Kurt and Tricia Baker founded Attitudes in Reverse (AIR) in 2011. AIR seeks to educate young people (and the public in general) about mental health issues, reduce stigma around mental illness, and prevent suicide, co-hosting a suicide prevention conference and presenting workshops in area high schools. All three of these organizations are founded on the idea of making the invisible (struggles with mental health) visible, so that stigma can be reduced and support strengthened. When we are seen and heard by others, we can be understood, and when we are understood, we have a chance at a life worth living.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">REPRESENTATION</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Representation in popular media also matters, as it is a shared source of information that constructs the lenses through which we judge the world around us. Representations of women as more likely to be mentally ill and less likely to be the experts treating mental illness, despite the fact that women are more likely than men to work in mental health fields, creates harmful stereotypes about both mental health and women’s work.¹⁰ Representation also matters for how women are viewed more globally. One study by Jeremiah Garretson published in the Journal of Politics Groups and Identities in 2015 found that the quality and quantity of minority women portrayed in television influenced attitudes of social tolerance.¹¹ For those who hold marginalized and minority identities, media representation can also become a source of pride and self-realization.</p><p class="calibre_1">As previously mentioned, Supernatural has not been without criticism for its portrayal of women, but its largely female-identified fan base has not been silent about this. In fact, one of the most widely known social action campaigns in the fandom has been Wayward Daughters, started by fans Riley Santangelo and Betty Days. Wayward Daughters started as a conversation about women characters on the show, and how to advocate for better story lines for women and other marginalized groups. Wayward Daughters would later partner with Random Acts, as well as actors Kim Rhodes and Briana Buckmaster (who plays Sheriff Donna Hanscum), in an effort to raise funds to build the previously mentioned school for women and girls in Nicaragua. Attend a Supernatural convention and you will likely see many fans wearing shirts from this and other campaigns by Wayward Daughters, and you may also hear whispers of a spinoff that almost was.</p><p class="calibre_1">In season 13, Supernatural aired a backdoor pilot for Wayward Sisters, a spinoff that would have followed women characters from the Supernatural universe, embodying the kind of representation that Wayward Daughters had been campaigning for. While the CW ultimately chose not to pick up the pilot, the fact that the pilot aired demonstrated how the show’s fandom had evolved over fifteen years. Diverse women who wanted to see themselves represented on-screen spoke, and the showrunners listened.</p><p class="calibre_1">Even though we didn’t get the Wayward series we wanted, after Wayward Daughters, there were far more women characters in recurring roles with stronger and more developed story arcs. The return of Mary Winchester in season 12, for example, led to some interesting reflexive storytelling that brought themes and conflicts from early in the show full circle. Mary’s independence and refusal to give up hunting after her return led Dean to challenge his idealized remembrances and long-buried conflicting feelings about her death. Mary in season 12 loves her sons but is also able to have her own life and her independence, a dramatic change from being killed as a plot device.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">LEGACY</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Over fifteen years, Supernatural has shown it is far more than your average genre show about handsome dudes who fight monsters. The story of two brothers in an epic battle between good and evil, who continuously (re) negotiate their family bonds with one another and those deemed honorary “Winchesters,” continues to resonate with fans and likely will for years to come. The longevity of the fandom, and fans’ engagement with one another and the series’ stars both online and in person at conventions, has fostered a crucible of emotional energy that has led to social movement–style activism. This dialogue with fans has also led to more well-developed women characters and stronger story arcs. The main legacy of Supernatural, however, may be its efficaciousness in motivating people to lift each other up and try to do more to benefit their communities and the world. When it comes to saving people and continuing to fight, the SPNFamily has shown there’s always a way.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">2.
