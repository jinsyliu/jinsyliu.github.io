</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Two words you don’t want to hear: Code Orange.</p><p class="calibre_1">In hospital-speak, it means “stroke.”</p><p class="calibre_1">This is a story about how the Supernatural fandom and a book called Family Don’t End with Blood saved my life . . . when I learned exactly what those two words meant.</p><p class="calibre_1">In order to tell this story, I must first tell you how I became part of the fandom. I started watching the show from the beginning. I liked that Dean listened to classic rock and heavy metal. When I saw Dean’s cassette collection in his ’67 Chevy Impala, I knew I would be hooked on this show. I also loved all of Sam’s Star Wars references.</p><p class="calibre_1">Fast-forward to 2016. My friend Jennifer is a Bon Jovi buddy (a friend I met through our mutual love of the band), and she started going to Creation Entertainment conventions for the television show The Vampire Diaries. They seemed like a lot of fun, so as a goof I went to a Walker Stalker con to meet the main characters from another show I loved, The Walking Dead, and of course to bring a Flat Jennifer (a paddle with a flattened version of my friend printed on it) to our next Vampire Diaries con photo op to poke fun at my friend. I met the actors, and they were so nice that I decided to try another one. I went on the Creation site and saw that they had Supernatural conventions. I’d had no idea! I was so excited that I would be meeting the stars of that show that I booked the closest convention and went solo to Washington, D.C., for my first Supernatural con. I ended up having an amazing time and, over a two-year span, I went to seven cons.</p><p class="calibre_1">Charity is big with the Supernatural fandom, and I try to support as many of the actors’ charities as I can afford because they do so much good that it’s hard not to participate and support these amazing actors. In this fandom, I found that we have many talented members. One in particular is an author of several books about the show, including Fangasm: Supernatural Fangirls and Family Don’t End with Blood. I bought those two books at the Supernatural con in New Jersey in 2017.</p><p class="calibre_1">I read both books in less than a day. One story from Family Don’t End with Blood that stood out for me was “Stroke of Luck” by Rob Benedict, who plays Chuck Shurley, also known as God (he also fronts the band Louden Swain). He shared his experience of surviving a serious stroke he suffered at a convention. His friends, the other actors, helped save his life. I had basic knowledge of the effects of a stroke because my grandmother and a few of my friends had suffered them, but I never knew what the signs of a stroke were until I read Rob’s chapter, in which he wrote about “not being himself” the day he experienced his stroke. And later in the day, he had difficulty putting words into speech. He also shared the signs of a stroke on Facebook. These two bits of information would be tremendously helpful to me in the next few months.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00026.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_22">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">On February 7, 2018, my life would change forever. As I got ready for bed, my hand started to go numb. I thought it was no big deal. I tried slapping it, but it would not “wake up.” The numbness slowly moved up my arm. Then I felt a pain in the back of my head, and my whole right side went numb. The right side of my face became droopy. It was like what had happened to Rob! I quickly realized I was having a stroke. I screamed for my husband and told him what was happening. He raced me to the hospital. While in the car, I couldn’t speak without slurring my words and my tongue felt fat. Was I going to die? I was terrified.</p><p class="calibre_1">My husband got us to the hospital in record time, parked in the emergency room entrance, got a wheelchair, and rolled me in. He told the admitting nurses what was happening to me, and the nurses rushed me into the hospital as a Code Orange. I was very fortunate that my hospital had a brand-new stroke unit, and they proceeded to take a CT scan of my brain and samples of blood from my arm. I felt nothing as they did this, which scared me even more. Thankfully, the CT scan showed a very small clot that blood thinners would rectify. The next day, the clot was gone and I started seeing improvements right away. I had feeling in my legs and my right arm, but my arm was still weak. My diagnosis was clear: I had suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a mini-stroke.</p><p class="calibre_1">A TIA presents with symptoms of a stroke that tend to go away in a short period of time. They last for up to 30 minutes and cause dizziness, weakness, vision problems, and difficulty speaking. There is a high risk of having a major stroke or other serious complication in the near future if the TIA is not effectively treated. In one study, the risk of a major stroke was fifty times greater, and 20 percent of those were fatal. A TIA is an especially serious risk if the person is over sixty and/or has diabetes, the TIA lasts more than ten minutes, and if the TIA causes weakness and speech problems. If any of these symptoms happen to you, you should get medical attention immediately to reduce the risk of a future stroke.</p><p class="calibre_1">I did get treatment right away, and so I ended up getting all the feeling back on my right side. I was able to talk without slurring my words, and within days I could walk and move my arms and legs. My doctor gave me the results from my tests several days later. My MRI showed that this mini-stroke was not my first. In fact, they found damage from a previous stroke that I never knew had occurred, which means this one was even more dangerous and the results could have been very different.</p><p class="calibre_1">My story has a happy ending, but I know that I probably would have ignored those first symptoms and gone to bed, most likely damaging my brain, if it hadn’t been for Rob’s story in Family Don’t End with Blood. I’m happy to say that I’m back to my old self with minimal damage. Many people have been changed in some way by Supernatural, but in my case, this amazing television show literally saved my life.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00037.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_39">
