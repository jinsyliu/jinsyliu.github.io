</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">While I was on medical leave in the fall of 2017, Netflix suggested I watch a show called Supernatural . Largely confined to bedrest, I watched and I watched and I watched pretty much nonstop for six weeks, and when it was done, I turned to my very patient husband and said, “I think I need to watch that again. There’s something important here.”</p><p class="calibre_1">As a leadership professor who studies how ancient belief systems guide modern behavior, the show’s content was dead-on in my wheelhouse. But that wasn’t it (or it wasn’t all of it). I had been searching for a tool to help a particular segment of my students, the increasing numbers of soldiers streaming into the university through the GI Bill. These students had unique needs and special struggles, and they needed a vehicle to help them transition into a world that didn’t always fit them well.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural and the lessons it teaches about heroism and bravery are powerful, and I was pretty sure the show would resonate with the veterans I wanted to create a safe space for. I wasn’t wrong. As I started digging through the many academic articles and books written about Supernatural and the years of interviews and convention footage, I became ever more convinced that I had found what I was looking for. Not only did the show’s story lines speak to me, but the real-life work of the cast and the extended SPNFamily shone with a special light that was truly inspirational.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">But I had to test my thinking with its intended audience. Over the course of the next year, I bounced my ideas off a number of students, men and women who were working hard to figure out how to maintain the values and integrity carved into them through years of military service while adapting to a new reality that framed things quite differently. Once I felt I had collected enough information to do this project justice, I offered a course using examples from the show, its cast, and its fandom to explore concepts of heroism, authenticity, and service.</p><p class="calibre_1">I am delighted to say that it worked! As one student said, “Studying the dynamic of the characters as they hunt demons and ghosts while saving the world from the apocalypse, I found great comfort in sharing the struggles with these two brothers. I battle with PTSD every day and experiencing the hardships with Dean and Sam helped me cope with my personal struggles and find strength to always keep fighting.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00087.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_20">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">While I anticipated this type of reaction from the soldiers interacting with the material in the course, I did not anticipate the depth of the raw, human connections students in the course would develop with each other. One nonveteran stated, “The growth that I had in being exposed to the veterans’ perspectives on support and transitions from a tribe/warrior lifestyle to trying to assimilate to ‘normal civilian life’ had a great impact on me. . . . The tie-in to the show and the experiences of the brothers constantly living in that on-edge state, ready for the next life-or-death battle, really showed me the strain that these vets have been under and how different it is from the life that has moved on from them while they are away fighting.”</p><p class="calibre_1">As my students worked through what Sam and Dean were experiencing, and what soldiers everywhere experience, they worked through a lot of their own challenges, using examples of divorce, death, and other trauma to illuminate human struggles and the power of the human spirit to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. And they began to meet outside of class to extend the support system in areas where they needed a bit of extra backup. Because their discussions were so real and so honest, they formed strong connections with one another.</p><p class="calibre_1">From the foundation of the show’s stories, we moved on to the examples of the cast and their leadership in the development of the SPNFamily. Although many in the class were new to this world and got to experience it with fresh eyes, even the superfans found a new appreciation for the singular nature of this phenomenon. As one said, “I knew the impact that Supernatural had on my life, but I was not aware of its impact on so many others. The depth and reach of this show has been remarkable. Through this class, I heard inspirational stories from others and saw the immensely positive effects not only from the show but its cast, crew, and fandom. This class gave me a new perspective on something that I loved and valued and showed me important examples of modern-day leaders.”</p><p class="calibre_1">Although the show’s leads are relatively humble in acknowledging their leadership roles, it is clear that they were quite deliberate in the tone they have established on set and for the fandom. Their love and appreciation of the SPNFamily are obvious. And it is this authentic and charismatic guidance that has given authorization for the myriad benefits that have arisen as the power of the SPNFamily collectively.</p><p class="calibre_1">Of particular importance is their embrace of difference and how we are all simply trying to do the best we can with what we are given. Because the cast is so open about their imperfections, others are free to come to peace with their own challenges and to embrace what makes them unique. In class, this was especially powerful for those who had often found themselves marginalized. They came to understand that it is okay to be who they are and that their tribe, people who share their passions and values, is out there somewhere. One of these students shared the following: “I learned that we need our people to be able to move forward, be motivated to succeed, and more. The show . . . showed that I was weird . . . but that was okay, because we all have a bit of weirdness in us.”</p><p class="calibre_1">With acceptance, people come out of the shadows. They seek out ways to connect with each other and to be connected to something larger than themselves. It was this empowerment that drew me to the SPNFamily, to catalog and celebrate what had been done and figure out ways to use these exemplars to enable the potential of the populations I work with.</p><p class="calibre_1">Inspired by the example the SPNFamily had set, I asked each student to spend a month doing acts of kindness in their communities, to seek out spaces where even a small act could make a huge difference in someone’s life. What they did and what they discovered was really beautiful. One drove a disabled man seven hours to his home so that he did not have to navigate a much longer trip on public transportation. One discovered that his elderly neighbor had not been able to manage after her basement flooded, so he cleaned everything up for her. One helped her daughter create a kindness project at school so that she and her classmates could serve their community.</p><p class="calibre_1">For soldiers especially, returning to civilian life comes at a price. Combat veterans have spent a long time under constant stress and return home tightly wound. Many who have troubles reintegrating experience a lack of purpose, feeling unneeded in a reality that has continued on without them. It is important for them to be reminded of the positive impact they already have on the people around them and to realize how much more they could be doing. It is important for us all.</p><p class="calibre_1">In leadership studies, we teach that a fundamental skill everyone should develop is a robust awareness of self and self in relation to others. As we explored the virtues of Supernatural and the stories of its characters, cast, and extended family, we exposed many things about ourselves: our strengths, our vulnerabilities, and our dreams. As we peeled away the layers of armor that life had laid upon us, we could become our true selves and, in this revelation, come to appreciate how truly powerful we all can be.</p><p class="calibre_1">After the semester ended, one student described it this way: “The bond in our class ever so subtly grew not only from our connections with Sam and Dean but how Sam and Dean helped connect us with each other. The shared experience and exploration of leadership within the context of the Supernatural series fostered an interplay between fiction and reality that eventually transcended our every expectation. In fact, it challenged us, provoked us, empowered us, and in ways healed us.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_68"></div>
