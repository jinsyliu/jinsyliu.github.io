</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Christmas morning, 1974, a six-year-old green-eyed boy bounces down the stairs on his butt (a preferred way of descending), in his home in Chicago. He rounds the corner to find, waiting for him from St. Nick, a cadre of Mego Planet of the Apes action figures and the treehouse playset. A Christmas wish come true. You see, my family would gather at my mother’s grandparents’ house every Sunday to tune in to CBS for the ritual airing of the Planet of the Apes TV series. There I was: belly on the floor, chin on hands, drinking it in. There was pizza.</p><p class="calibre_1">This was my first fandom. I devoured the merch, played Planet of the Apes with my cousin, drew pictures of this fantastic world. I didn’t become a fanboy; I noticed that I was one. From here I moved on to Star Trek, wherein I devoured the merch, played Star Trek with my cousin, drew pictures of this fantastic world. Then it was all eclipsed by the “I-am-your-father” of all fandoms, Star Wars. I devoured the merch, played Star Wars with my cousin, drew pictures of this fantastic world. You see the pattern.</p><p class="calibre_1">So basically, my earliest memories are those of my fandoms. These stories, characters, and lands (cynically now referred to as IPs) defined my play, and my play informed how I interacted with the world. It was this early childhood imagining and playacting that set the stage for what I now do for a living. As I grew, my fandoms continued to dominate conversations among my peers: preteens of the early ’80s, speculating, arguing, and poring over every prereleased image in Starlog magazine. This was who we were; this is who we are. This is how we nerd. And we nerd hard.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00014.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_20">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">In the forty-plus years since I collected Planet of the Apes action figures, nothing has changed. Everything has changed. That which was considered nerd culture is now culture. Avengers are now on our soda cans. BUT what’s fascinating to me about us hard-core nerds is that we like to burrow. While the greater culture sloppily ingests the blockbuster franchises, there is the deep cut, the fandoms that are quietly flowing like an underground river. These fandoms may eventually break through to the wider public, but they exist for a good long time as a private club, a secret handshake, a quiet whisper beneath the noise of culture. It is the way of the nerd to boldly go where no one has gone. Giving our eyeballs to a new story that might just excite us in a fresh way. Now, it’s all Taco Bell, the same ingredients just reassembled in slightly different ways. Horror, sci-fi, fantasy . . . these stories are fueled by familiar tropes: vampires, dragons, laser swords. It’s these tropes that draw us to them in the first place. We love them, or some of them, or one of them. We are always seeking a new way to devour them, and it is really fun when we find one that not many have caught on yet. We want to hold it close, and at the same time, sing its song from the mountaintop. Add to our tribe.</p><p class="calibre_1">This was Supernatural, fifteen years ago.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I can say, like many, that Supernatural changed my life. Here’s the insane part: it was just a week of my life, up in Vancouver, June 2008. Then the episode (“Monster Movie”) aired, on my fortieth birthday, October 16, 2008. One episode and done, and yet there are very few jobs that have been more celebrated than my week on Supernatural. The job itself was some of the most fun I have ever had acting. If one were a cheeseball, they’d say I really got to sink my teeth into the role. Rarely as actors do we get a chance to play huge and scene chewing and then moments later be so small and broken and intimate. I got to work with some of the kindest, most dedicated, talented folks. It was a reunion for Jared and me. We had shot a pilot together seven years prior. I love that guy. Jensen is such a hoot and a consummate professional, even after I accidently whacked him in the face for real. From the sets, to my costume and makeup, to that scooter—it was a dream job. As a horror nerd boy, I had the honor of stepping into Lugosi’s shiny black shoes. Also . . . there was pizza (no garlic).</p><p class="calibre_1">I am continually humbled by the fact that eleven seasons later, that episode is celebrated. It resonated for some reason. My Dracula has been made into many a GIF, for cry-eye. That one little episode has taken me to cons across America and overseas. I have made friends who will be in my life forever. It is a testament to everyone involved in making such a high-quality show and also a testament to the passionate fans. The fans who have embraced this lovely blue-collar show about family and monsters. The fans have taken it from the “secret club” into a staple at Hot Topic. The fans who fill convention centers around the world, get themselves tattooed, name their children Sam and Dean, devour the merch, and draw pictures of this fantastic world. The fans who will need each other when the show finishes its last season. There will be tears.</p><p class="calibre_1">My professional career has been a fanboy’s dream. My livelihood is not just limited to acting. I also have made a comfortable living as a writer. I have written comic books, video games, television pilots, and screenplays, all of them in horror, sci-fi, and fantasy. I have been able to contribute to the mythologies that I love and also dream up new ones yet to be discovered. The fact that I have gotten to contribute to worlds that I adore, watching as much as any fan, still spins me. This life has been filled with many checks off the nerd bucket list.</p><p class="calibre_1">We are tribal creatures who use mythology to come together and understand ourselves. The television is our campfire. Being a small part of the Supernatural tribe showed me a lot about fandom. I’ve got a unique perspective by being connected to something that folks are beyond passionate about. I get to talk to, share a drink with, or sing a song for so many people who love this show and are excited that I can provide a window into it. I get it, because I am them. Since I learned to walk, I too have always wanted to revel in my own nerderies. I still wear Star Wars T-shirts. I attend cons even when I’m not promoting something. I spend way too much time and money scouring eBay to find action figures from the ’70s to add to my bloated collection. I’m confident in saying that I will never stop being a fan, and also confident in saying that there’s always pizza . . . and I have a coupon.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_42"></div>
