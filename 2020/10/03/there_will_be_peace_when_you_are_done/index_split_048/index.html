</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">For over a decade, I’ve written epic fantasy and urban fantasy books. I started out published by a large British publisher and a big New York City house, and that grew to include a variety of small and mid-size presses, plus independent publishing. Ghost stories, creepy urban legends, monsters, magic, supernatural threats, and the people who fight them . . . that’s what I write. But somehow, I didn’t find Supernatural until 2016.</p><p class="calibre_1">I came late to the Supernatural party, only “discovering” the show when it was already halfway through season 11. I binge-watched all eleven seasons in time for the premiere of season 12, and began live-tweeting new episodes. I made friends on Twitter, and ended up getting to meet Lynn, the editor of this volume of essays, via Fangasm, and also met the folks at the The Winchester Family Business blog, for whom I’ve written a couple of guest blog posts.</p><p class="calibre_1">The hiatus before season 12 was intolerable, so I did something I hadn’t done in decades—dove into reading fan fiction. I got my start, back in high school, writing fan fiction to amuse my friends, and it not only taught me a lot about writing, but it also convinced me I could entertain people with my stories. Then I got busy with work and family, got my publishing break, and wandered away from my fan fiction roots. So I was thrilled to discover the vibrant transformative works to be enjoyed in the Supernatural fandom, and went down the rabbit hole, reading several hundred stories in a matter of months.</p><p class="calibre_1">Then I took a turn in another direction and discovered the Supernatural slash stories (stories that pair either two male or two female characters romantically). I read several hundred of those, came up for air, and wondered what the non-fandom, published male/male romances looked like. So I read a couple hundred of those. At which point, I decided this was too much fun to miss out on, so I launched my Morgan Brice pen name, and added “bestselling urban fantasy male/male paranormal romance” to my writing career—a whole new subgenre and audience—and it all started because of Supernatural. I joke that as both Gail and Morgan, I’ve always written worlds where Sam and Dean could walk in and feel right at home.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural gave me back the sheer joy of fangirling, something I’d lost in the flurry of deadlines and adulting. It rekindled my passion for storytelling and gave me the courage to step out into new territory. I found my SPNFamily and developed new friendships and an essential connection to a wonderful new group of people. So of course, I also started attending Supernatural conventions, where my bonds to this fandom family grew even stronger. And through that, I started the Supernatural TFWNC Facebook group, which is now a fun, vibrant community with lots always going on. If you follow me on social media, you’ll see that I tweet and post a lot about the show, because it’s become a central part of my life.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural is actually not the first television show to change my life: Star Trek (the original series) was. I grew up during the Cold War, with parents who believed we were all about to die in an imminent attack by the USSR, and in a church that believed the End of Days was upon us and we were all going to either be Raptured or die in Armageddon. (I have since strongly disavowed both views, but when you’re a kid, you believe what the people you trust tell you is real.) I did not have any reason to expect that I would live long enough to grow up. Then I discovered Star Trek, and for the first time, I experienced not just an expectation that we could have a better future, but that we could have a future at all. I was obsessed with this show that held out a vision that people of all races, cultures, and planetary origins could work together in friendship and harmony. The show gave me hope, where there had been none before. Star Trek was definitely one of my first steps toward becoming a professional fantasy writer, and it introduced me to fandom.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">Many years later, I found Supernatural at a difficult period of transition in my publishing career, when I was making the shift from being exclusively traditionally published to having more control—and risk—in independent publishing. I needed heroes, and I needed hope. After I’d fallen hard for the show, I realized that one of the things that also made it dear to my heart was that where Star Trek had overcome the first of my dystopian childhood fears, Sam and Dean stopped the Apocalypse, my other fundamental nightmare. A dark shadow that I didn’t even know still stalked me was finally exorcised.</p><p class="calibre_1">I believe that finding fandom saved my life. It gave me a place where I belonged, and it gave me a desire to help create a better future. Fandom became a new kind of family, one that understood and supported me in a way my birth family never could. Fandom has also been a shelter for those of us who don’t always fit in out there. We’re different, but we belong together. In fandom, we support each other, and protect each other, and that’s certainly a core part of our SPNFamily.</p><p class="calibre_1">This is what I love about fandom. Fandom is fierce. We’ve got the biggest damn BAMF heroes who stand for truth, justice, and, most importantly, the idea that humanity’s better self can ultimately prevail. Our heroes are flawed and scarred. They make mistakes and they pay a price, but they do not give up, give in, or give way. They inspire us to find the hero inside of ourselves.</p><p class="calibre_1">What drew me to fandom in general, and to Supernatural in particular, were stories that shared a deep belief in honor, loyalty, friendship, integrity, courage, family (both family by blood and family by choice), and, in spite of apocalypses and dystopias, a conviction that we will survive if we keep faith with each other and refuse to leave anyone behind.</p><p class="calibre_1">The year after Jared Padalecki’s Always Keep Fighting (AKF) campaign came out, I’d seen a panel at a genre convention talking about depression and mental health that had standing-room-only attendance, went overtime, and had people so hungry to keep the discussion going that they met up later online. I had been very inspired by AKF because I have always wrestled with depression and anxiety. I realized that while I didn’t know any actors, I did know a whole bunch of authors, and I was also aware that so many of us had dealt with some kind of depression or other mental health issues, either ourselves or in our personal circles. Those experiences not only shaped our own lives, but also the characters we wrote about and the stories we told.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00064.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_22">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">So I reached out to my author friends, the people whose books create the genres, and Hold On To The Light was born, with its roots solidly in the legacy of AKF. #HoldOnToTheLight is a blog campaign with posts by authors from around the world in an effort to stand in solidarity with fans and to raise awareness around treatment for depression, suicide prevention, domestic violence intervention, PTSD initiatives, bullying prevention, and other mental health–related issues. We believe fandom should be supportive, welcoming, and inclusive, in the long tradition of fandom taking care of its own. We encourage readers and fans to seek the help they or their loved ones need without shame or embarrassment. #HoldOnToTheLight is now an ongoing campaign with nearly 200 posts and authors, ranging from mega bestsellers to mid-listers to debut writers, talking with amazing candor about coping with the situations they have faced, holding out hope for a better tomorrow, and letting readers know that they aren’t alone.</p><p class="calibre_1">One of the other things that I love about Supernatural, and that I think is part of the show’s phenomenal success and legacy, is the fact that while our heroes are “the guys who save the world,” we have also seen those badass heroes cry, show fear, express doubts, and be vulnerable. Their ability to show emotion doesn’t take away from their heroics or their masculinity. In a culture that gives us many unhealthy signals about bottling up feelings and not showing “weakness” (especially for men), seeing the Winchesters express their emotions and acknowledge vulnerability is hugely important.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00074.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_36">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I once had an editor try to pressure me into removing all the “feelings” scenes in an epic fantasy book (when the hero grieved the loss of his home and people dear to him). The editor didn’t think it was necessary to include that. To me, it was essential to show that while the hero was a warrior, it didn’t keep him from feeling love, loss, or trauma, or craving the connection of family and loyal friends. (Many of the heroes I write live with PTSD.) Fifteen seasons of Winchester angst has made me feel very vindicated for leaving those scenes in the book!</p><p class="calibre_1">One thing I’ve learned from four decades of being active in fandom is that TV shows and book series may end, but the love that binds fans of those stories together never stops. I truly believe that after Supernatural’s fifteenth season comes to a close, the fandom and the SPNFamily will continue to burn bright and stay strong, for as long as we cherish the stories; bring new fans into the fold; and share our love of the characters, the actors, and the series with each other. Good stories last, and great stories become legends. The Supernatural legend will live forever.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_50"></div>
