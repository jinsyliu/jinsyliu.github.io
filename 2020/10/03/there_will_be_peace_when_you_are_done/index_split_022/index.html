</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Moving to Canada, thereby leaving my telenovela career in Mexico behind, was one of the riskiest, but ultimately most rewarding decisions of my life. Adapting to a new country with a very different culture was a big challenge, but I embraced the adventure gleefully, completely unaware of how big the challenge would end up being. At the time, I had a substantial résumé, which helped open doors to many big-profile auditions. I had great training and a lot of experience, but I didn’t realize how different it would be to act in English. My lack of proficiency and my thick accent made me a bad match for many roles.</p><p class="calibre_1">One particular audition stands out in my memory. When I read the invitation to audition for a show called Supernatural, I thought I was perfect for the role. “Castiel is a demon. He is charming, intelligent, but” if I remember the description correctly “somewhat morally flexible. He is helping someone come back from hell to be reunited with his family.” It was a really fun audition to go to, and only in hindsight did I realize how this may have been the biggest audition I didn’t land.</p><p class="calibre_1">Not often talked about, but pivotal to the trajectory of an actor’s career, is the long list of roles that we really, really want, but never have the chance to perform. I knew another chance would come to audition for this show, and I knew that if I kept working hard I would be ready for it. Years passed and the audition I hoped for wasn’t forthcoming; yet, as I followed the growth of Supernatural into the phenomenon it has become, I never let go of my desire to get a juicy part on the show.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00035.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_21">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Life happened and I moved away from Vancouver—first to London, then to Greece—before the beauty of Vancouver and its career opportunities called me back. At long last, I was invited to audition for a character on Supernatural named César Cuevas. The audition called for just two brief scenes, but it seemed like a substantial role. I was thrilled to get the callback, even more so when I met Eduardo Sánchez, the director of the episode for which I would be cast. I was greeted personally by him and he took quite some time to work directly with me to understand the role and his directorial intentions. It was then that I first learned that the character of Jesse, whom I had assumed was my brother, was actually my husband.</p><p class="calibre_1">I hadn’t been auditioning for a supernatural creature, a demon, or a ghost.</p><p class="calibre_1">César was a man committed to helping his partner, the love of his life, face the demons that had crippled him in his childhood. César was a badass fighter, prepared to risk his own life to defend his beloved in the hopes of one day living a life of peace and togetherness in love.</p><p class="calibre_1">So, I had not landed the role of a supernatural creature, a demon, or a ghost; instead, it was a gay superhero! I couldn’t have been happier that this role was mine!</p><p class="calibre_1">Throughout my acting career, I was often denied the chance to play gay characters because “I was not believable as gay.” Strangely, actually being gay (or being an actor) was not considered qualification enough to play a gay character. It was the appearance of being gay that was often considered more relevant than one’s ability to act convincingly and develop a full-fledged character. If you were thin and slight, with a high-pitched voice and angular features, you were more likely to be cast for gay roles.</p><p class="calibre_1">As a gay man, it was frustrating to be told that I was not believable as gay. Of course, this was code for “We would like to continue dealing in stereotypes.” You can imagine my surprise when I was suddenly offered the opportunity to play a gay character who defied all stereotypes: César lives in the woods, and he is not glamorous or effeminate or identifiable at all by the characteristics of a stereotypically gay man. However, he does happen to be in love with another man.</p><p class="calibre_1">At the time of my audition, I was heavier than usual and not particularly fit. In truth, I looked more like a tubby, middle-aged man, a regular no-frills Joe, than a gym-going self-obsessed man-child, which is another gay stereotype we often see. While being gay is a characteristic of both César and Jesse, it is just one aspect of their lives and not a defining one. There are many other traits that better identify who they are: pained, caring, brave, complex, insecure, angry, and tender. And they are determined to change their circumstances so they can live together and love each other in peace. They just happen to be human beings who are gay.</p><p class="calibre_1">When I met Lee Rumohr, the actor who played my character’s husband, Jesse, I found out that he wasn’t gay. Despite myself, I have to admit that this made me a little nervous. At first, I debated disclosing to him that I’m gay, fearful of a straight man’s reaction to a gay actor playing his husband. But it only took a few minutes of chatting with Lee for my fears to evaporate completely. He was open-minded, sweet, relaxed, and intelligent. And, just as I was, he was inspired by the deep love our characters felt for each other. I was so happy at how easy it was for us both to find a total sense of comfort with one another and develop a genuine rapport, a connection that we share to this day.</p><p class="calibre_1">The incredibly good luck that got me cast for this role continued on set. Both Lee and I were greeted by a warm and friendly cast and crew. The vibe on set was happy and relaxed, and we felt supported and welcome. When we met Jared and Jensen, they were so at ease and appreciative of everybody’s contributions. It felt like more than just a television set. It felt like we were spending time with a very happy family. (Years later, I had the same experience on the set of Siren.) It is amazing how important the role of the lead is when it comes to setting the tone of the entire company. Eduardo Sánchez’s careful, insightful, and very trusting direction made my experience all the more enjoyable and fulfilling. The entire process was an incredibly positive experience for me and one of the most memorable of my career to this day.</p><p class="calibre_1">Although I knew we were creating something special during filming, I was unsure how the Supernatural fandom would react to our characters. I had the impression that, being a family-oriented show, there might be some pushback because our characters were gay, so I was very happy to learn that when the episode aired it had touched a lot of people.</p><p class="calibre_1">There is something very powerful about seeing yourself represented on-screen, not as a cliché, but as a relevant, believable, worthwhile human being. I believe that is what many of the fans appreciated about the episode. It is what touched me about it.</p><p class="calibre_1">I had never engaged much with social media before working on Supernatural, but after the episode aired, Lee called to tell me that people were asking about me through his Twitter account. He convinced me to sign up. The morning after I did, I already had more than a thousand followers, which was a bit of a shock for an actor who hadn’t previously bothered with social media. I soon abandoned Twitter (I really didn’t get it) and switched to Instagram, which suited my personality better. Thus began the adventure of interacting directly with the audience, which was brand-new to me. I now have a diverse group of people with whom I interact, some from my soap opera days, some who follow my current work. And definitely, some of my most passionate followers are Supernatural fans. I am happy that I now get to interact directly with my new friends and family.</p><p class="calibre_1">I am grateful to have been a part of the cultural phenomenon known as Supernatural, a show that evolved with the times throughout its many seasons. I am very fortunate to have been a part of such a groundbreaking episode. While I never did get to play the scary demon that I had dreamed of, the role I ended up playing was so much more meaningful and impactful that it was worth waiting all those years!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_24"></div>
