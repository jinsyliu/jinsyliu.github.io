</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Fifteen years is a long time to be on a television show. When Jared and I were in our twenties, we went to Vancouver thinking that we’d just put our lives on hold and press pause for maybe a season or two, and then we’d come back, press play, and life would go on.</p><p class="calibre_1">That’s not what happened.</p><p class="calibre_1">It just never got un-paused. And I’m very thankful for that.</p><p class="calibre_1">We were on Supernatural when the first iPhone came out. We were on Supernatural when Twitter began. It took a long time before we were confident that we’d have another season, but over the years we kept coming back and coming back as they moved us around in the lineup. Some of those slots that we ended up in were the slots they put shows in to die. But we didn’t die—the fandom kept us alive. Fan support has actually increased over the years, and that’s been one of the most humbling things that has happened to us. We’ve watched new people continuously join the fandom with the changing TV landscape of binge-watching and streaming. That’s been the most shocking thing to us—that the fandom continued to grow. Looking back now, I’m proud of the work that this team has done for this long, because it has been a team. It takes a lot of very talented people to make television, to give viewers the best product we can make, and I’m really proud of that product. After this long on a show, to still truly love what we do and be proud to hang my hat on that at the end of the day . . . that’s what I’m going to take with me. That’s one of the legacies that I’m proudest of, knowing that we all put in the effort and nobody phoned it in.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00082.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_30">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I’m also proud of the tone we’ve had on our set. It’s one of the best compliments we can receive as a cast and crew when guest stars or guest directors say that they love the tone of the set and feel like it’s a welcoming, warm environment where they can create and have a good time, and they want to come back. More times than I can count, we’ve had people say that this is the best set they’ve ever been on and one of the most fun and comfortable sets they can remember. Nobody likes to work in a toxic environment. I’ve been on sets like that, with everybody walking around on eggshells. So Jared and I have made an effort. We know that when we walk on that set, we’re setting a tone. And I’m proud that he and I have put in the effort to make our home a place where everybody’s welcome.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s hard to express what I’m going to take away from this. Lifelong friends . . . experiences of a lifetime. I think that the people who have found Supernatural and become part of the fandom and found each other through the show—the SPNFamily—are probably the legacy that we’re going to be proudest of. We are so fortunate to have a fandom that is so charitable and vocal. I’ve heard more times than I can count, “I met my best friend through the show.” I love that there’s such a love for each other, and for us; it’s a really cool relationship to be in with a fandom. We may not have won a lot of awards or have accolades covering our mantels, but when we walked out on that stage at Comic-Con for our last panel in Hall H and heard nearly 7,000 people applaud us, that was about as big an award as we could have ever won in our lives. It was like a celebration of what we’ve all built together with Supernatural, and it was very emotional. It’s not awards or reviews that determine whether a show is successful; it’s the relationship with the fans. If you make yourself accessible like we have and you can interact with the fans and they can tell you their stories and why the show means something to them . . . that’s success. Our fans are better than any award.</p><p class="calibre_1">The decision to end the show was not an easy one. This world has lasted much longer than maybe we originally intended it to, and I’m very thankful for that. We made this decision with heavy hearts, but at the same time, we never wanted to stick around so long that the production started to wane. We felt like we still had tons of energy, tons of passion, and tons of love for the show, so we wanted to go out with a bang. Nobody wanted to see the show fizzle out. We wanted to do the biggest service to this show that we could by going out strong. So it was taking that leap of faith and saying, well, let’s get out that paint and paint the finish line and hold our heads high because what we’ve accomplished is unlike any other. We wanted to do justice to this crew who has stuck with us all this time and to this family and to these characters and to the fans that have kept us going. One of the reasons why we were able to be here so long is because this was never just a job. It was an amazing opportunity that Jared and I recognized and held on to for dear life.</p><p class="calibre_1">What will I miss about playing Dean? I’ll miss his badassery. As a functioning person in society, you don’t really get to do the things that Dean does. I will miss walking into a room with all the confidence in the world and lopping off a vampire’s head or throwing a ’67 Impala into a reverse 180. I’ll miss all those cool things that we got to do. And along with the badassery, I’ll miss the humility that is also peppered into these characters. I think that balance is what makes them real to us and what makes them real to the fans. You can’t just have someone who’s always a badass and never breaks. There has to be that balance and that vulnerability. I think being able to play those two extremes is cathartic for us as actors, and I will miss being able to do that. It has been a privilege to play a character like Dean who has inspired so many people, because any excuse to give up is not an excuse that is good enough for the Winchesters. This is who they are. They fought because they believed in what they were fighting for, and that’s a part of the show that people connect with—to keep fighting the good fight, not giving up because the odds are stacked against you. Supernatural embodies that kind of resilience. I think Dean’s legacy is that he never gives up. He keeps fighting no matter what. The show carries the message to always keep fighting for each other, and that has inspired the fandom to keep fighting too, whatever fight they are facing.</p><p class="calibre_1">I don’t think we’ll ever say goodbye to these characters. They’re woven into the fabric of our makeup and who we are as individuals. I think for many years we have pulled from aspects of our own personalities and our own selves to craft our characters, so it all comes from a place that is within us already. It’s gonna be really tough hanging up those boots and hanging up the keys to the Impala. I’ve been doing this the majority of my adult life, and it’s been quite a ride. This show changed our lives fifteen years ago, it’s changed our lives several times since, and we will never be the same.</p><p class="calibre_1">When I look back on Supernatural and what I’m proud of, it’s that we got to the tell the story of Sam and Dean and how they always kept fighting against whatever odds and whatever struggles. What has made the most difference to people in real life is that the show has carried that message. We started out thinking we were making a horror show about monsters, but it became clear pretty quickly that’s not what made the show important. So many fans have told me that what is special is that it’s a show about two brothers who will do anything to fight for each other and to fight to save the world. Not in a way that people tell them to or according to what’s written in a book, but by making their own choices about what’s right and wrong and always trying to do what’s right. That’s the legacy of the show and that’s what has made a difference.</p><p class="calibre_1">And let’s be clear. Supernatural will never end. The show might, but what it has built? This will never end. Besides, nothing ever stays dead on Supernatural.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00093.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_40">
