</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Irecently attended a Supernatural convention in Jacksonville, Florida, and a little girl came onstage dressed as Dr. Badass, my character from the show. It was unlike anything I had ever seen. I’d seen people dress as my character before, but to see this young girl and know that she related to Ash was amazing. Knowing that Ash resonates with so many people is wonderful to me.</p><p class="calibre_1">I think it’s because Ash is fun. He’s charismatic and he’s comic relief that is sometimes very needed on the show. Before Ash, we hadn’t seen a character come along with a mullet where the mullet electrifies rather than gets made fun of! The mullet did so much of the work, but I think fans connected with the character because he’s quirky, and thank goodness people responded to that. He’s also not stereotypical in the sense of the masculinity that is presented on the show. That was appealing to fans, because Supernatural is so inclusive, encompassing every sort of human being possible. It’s hard to find another show that has that magic about it. Sometimes you don’t know what’s going to work and what’s going to connect with people, but Ash did.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I am disappointed that they didn’t explore the Roadhouse further on the show. I think, looking back, that they probably should have. So many people want to see the old characters in some capacity. Back then, they thought about making us regulars (Ash, Ellen, and Jo), but they were still trying to find their footing at the time, and then it took off and became what it became.</p><p class="calibre_1">The experience of being on the show itself was extraordinary. A special moment that stands out occurred during season 5, when I had to shotgun a beer and didn’t know how. (It’s on the blooper reel if you want to see it.) I had brought my sister to the set with me that day, because she loves Supernatural and of course she loves Jensen. I mean, who doesn’t love Jensen? So I said to him, “I don’t know how to shotgun a beer. It’s not my thing.” And he responds—read this in a deep Jensen-type voice—“Well, what you wanna do is, you wanna come over here and . . .” And he tries to show me how to cut into the beer, where you hold it, and where you chug it from. He’s showing me and I’m learning and then I look over at my sister and she’s just trying so hard to keep it together, because she’s standing right next to Jensen Ackles! That’s priceless stuff.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00047.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_40">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">So he shows me how to do the beer thing. The beers on set are terrible. They smell like sulfur, and of course they’re nonalcoholic. As I chug the beer for the scene, the bad beer is flowing out the side of the can and all over my mullet and onto the floor. I have no idea what’s going on, so I just keep doing my lines. Then I look over and I see Jared and Jensen with tears in their eyes as they try to keep it together. Once I realized what I was doing, I decided to push it further, just going with it, and then Jensen yelled, “Cut!”</p><p class="calibre_1">Everybody was laughing—Jensen and Jared, the crew, the cast, my sister. And I forget who it was, but someone came up to me afterward and said, “Thanks, we needed that today.” It had been a lot of work and things were kind of tense on set, and that broke the tension. And going back to what I said at the start, I think that’s what Ash brought to everyone. It was like, we need to laugh, and this guy’s silly. Both for the people watching the show and for the people making the show. I could put on the mullet and people would go apeshit on set, especially in season 5.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">People who watch Supernatural are often curious about the paranormal work I do in addition to acting. I tell them that Supernatural is as far out as it gets as far as a television show, but it’s all based in some sort of truth, in the myths and the legends. That’s what the show’s creator, Eric Kripke, wanted. And a lot of those things are real, but strangely enough, working on the show had nothing to do with me going into the paranormal. It was just one of those coincidences that happens to be cool. Shortly before I got cast on Supernatural, I decided to explore paranormal work after watching Ghost Adventures. This was before social media, but I reached out to the Ghost Adventures folks and they graciously had me on their show. From there, I started my “career” or my own path in the paranormal. It kinda turned into the real Sam and Dean, in a sense. And so of course, then I got cast on Supernatural!</p><p class="calibre_1">Now I go out and find ghosts—or more likely, they find me—and I take people out on ghost hunts. I hope that they walk away having had fun and that we can have some conversations between the living and the dead. We go to various locations, and I always say that we’re going to visit people, and they don’t have to do anything or say anything if they don’t want to. We’re going to visit their place. I usually feel confident that I can walk in somewhere and get “someone” to say hi, though. We’re all just floating on this crazy planet trying to figure out what’s going on, and we need things like Supernatural and the paranormal to anchor ourselves to. Sometimes we need some validation, like, “All right, there really are things out there I can’t explain.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">When I’m filming something, I never have any clue what impact my work will have or how it will be perceived. When we shot the show, it had not yet become the phenomenon that it is today. Then it literally took off and became a global phenomenon, something none of the original cast saw coming. Because of this show, I’ve been able to travel the world for conventions and see some of the most insane places on earth. Paris, Brazil, Germany, London, the list goes on. All because of my time on Supernatural. The show has turned me into a world traveler.</p><p class="calibre_1">I think one of the reasons Supernatural became such a phenomenon is because it’s a show about family, something we can all relate to. In addition, I think everyone finds the supernatural and the paranormal interesting. We all have a fascination with myths and legends, and that was part of Eric Kripke’s vision. And then, you’ve got Jared and Jensen, who literally have this amazing chemistry. All that mixed together made magic, and people responded to it, and it made them feel incredibly good. The show and the fandom made viewers feel included; it made them feel like they could be themselves. As the show has gone on, the conventions have turned into very safe places for people, where they can come and be themselves and be loved and feel love. There’s really nothing like it in the world.</p><p class="calibre_1">I don’t like to say “fans”; it really is the “SPNFamily.” They have been there for me for my good times and they have been there through my really hard times. They’ve helped me get through some very difficult family situations. They’ve shown up, and I know I can count on them. It’s rare that I don’t get emotional talking about the SPNFamily, because it really does go deep. I can’t properly put words to the love that I receive online, and especially in person at conventions. It’s something that’s true magic and true love. I feel lucky to be a part of something like that.</p><p class="calibre_1">When it comes to the legacy that the show will leave behind, let me say that first, I don’t think Supernatural will ever die; it will always be around. People are going to continue to want their Supernatural, and the conventions will hopefully continue forever because we all need a place to come together. I go to the conventions to see my friends—people I didn’t necessarily work with on the show but who have become great friends of mine. Supernatural has changed people. It has changed anyone who has watched and cares about the show. And that is its legacy: those people will go forward as different and more confident people.</p><p class="calibre_1">I will go forward as a different person too. I’m so thankful for the relationships I’ve been able to forge with this show, this cast, and this fandom. It’s unlike anything else, and I’m forever grateful.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_64"></div>
