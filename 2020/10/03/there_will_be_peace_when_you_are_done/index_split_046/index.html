</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">To say I’m grateful for Supernatural is an understatement. I had no idea what I was getting into when I was cast as Anna Milton. I had no idea that my time on that show would still be some of my favorite days on any set, ever. I had no idea that for five or six years after filming I would still be traveling the United States and the world, going to cons and meeting the enthusiastic and incredibly loyal fandom. And nothing prepared me for the friends I would make, the singing I would do, or the belly laughs that I’d have.</p><p class="calibre_1">Playing Anna—one of my first big roles—was a huge learning experience for me. I was given the role of a meek, terrified, wide-eyed young woman—and then trusted by the incredible writers and producers to become a badass angel who would risk everything to save the world. To be honest, that sort of trust and opportunity is rare in this industry, and it’s something I am constantly striving for in my work to this day. It’s so very easy to be seen one way and one way only by casting/producers, and it’s incredibly difficult to break out of that box and expand their ideas about you. So many of my auditions since playing Anna have been scenes where I would play a woman crying about a lost/dying partner/child. And I’m good at these characters. Vulnerability seeps out of me. That’s part of who I am, and I’m not trying to hide it. But I am much more than that, and I always hope for roles that will allow me to express that.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00054.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_35">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">With Anna, I had Jensen, Jared, Genevieve, and Misha on set guiding me (whether they knew it or not) through one of my first big roles. I really couldn’t have asked for a better group. Basically, I laughed ten hours a day and did some super-serious, save-the-world acting in between the laughter.</p><p class="calibre_1">The people who surround you when you’re a relatively inexperienced actor have a great impact on that experience and on the actor you end up becoming. One of the first things you learn as an actor is to “find your light”—to make sure you’re standing somewhere that’s lit by stage lighting. But on set, as a relatively new screen actor with microphones being shoved down my shirt, going over my lines in my head at 2 a.m. in the freezing cold, finding my light slipped my mind. During the scene where Dean and Anna are in Bobby’s junkyard leaning on the car talking about chocolate cake and sex, as people do, Jensen reminded me, kindly, to find my light. Now this is something I don’t have to think about. It’s part of an actor’s dance that happens naturally. But, during a set-up, if I find myself in a shadow, Jensen pops into my head and reminds me.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">One of the strangest things for me as an actor is when I have to be half naked and intimate with someone I barely know . . . in front of a crew of mostly men. Supernatural wasn’t my first sex scene, but I came into it wary because of an experience on another show where I was unaware that certain angles of my semi-nude body were captured. Similar to how Anna grew and learned to own her power, I needed to own mine as well. In this business, there’s a tendency to not want to make a fuss about anything . . . to be helpful, quiet, and no trouble at all. Perhaps I was naive with my previous sex scene . . . or perhaps I just wanted to be seen as easy to work with. But really, I wasn’t owning my space or my body.</p><p class="calibre_1">This time, I wanted to make sure I had more control of what was going to be seen. I expressed this to Jensen, and he made sure I could see exactly what each shot looked like, and he covered me up quickly between takes. Besides the bizarreness of the director’s voice coming through the walkie-talkie in the car, literally talking Jensen and me through the scene like a soft-core porn flick, everything else was just as weird as one would expect it would be. But together we got through it. In the end, I was pleased that I had Jensen’s support, and that I took control of what parts of my body would be seen. My experience on Supernatural helped me do that—find that sense of control and ownership. Just like Anna did.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I have adored my entire experience with Supernatural, from my time on set to the cons. I will admit, though, that it took a few cons to get comfortable, and truly, it was the fandom that helped me with this adjustment. I have never met a more welcoming, inclusive, lovely group of magical beings. I was nervous at first and had no idea what to expect when I stepped on stage at my first con. But the Supernatural Family welcomed me with open arms. When I spoke to some of the fans during signing or photos, they would share how they related to Anna. I love hearing fans’ stories of how Anna inspired them. I think, for some, what they related to most was her personal growth. We all feel small and scared at some point in our lives, just like Anna did, and when we discover our strength and allow it to shine, we become who we want to be.</p><p class="calibre_1">When Anna found her strength, she was finally able to get rid of the voices in her head and stand by her comrades and fight. Okay, so yes, she momentarily killed Sam. But she did this because she believed it would save the world. Yes, she was wrong and ultimately paid the price with her life (thanks, Michael), but she did what she thought was best. Maybe she was rash in making this decision alone. Had she listened to Castiel, her friend of two thousand years, would she be ash on the floor of an abandoned house stuck in 1978? Maybe the lesson here is that even though you’ve become an empowered badass, you should still listen to your friends. Yes, even after they’ve locked you in heaven’s jail.</p><p class="calibre_1">(Speaking of Cas and Michael, I have a bone to pick with them. Or rather, Anna does. I personally am totally cool with being stuck in the past [sarcasm] and staying a pile of ash for all eternity [more sarcasm]. Or wait . . . is Anna stuck in the Empty? We may never know.)</p><p class="calibre_1">There’s another way in which Supernatural has changed my life. I can’t express how happy I am to have become friends with the cast members. I know I can reach out to any of the SPN ladies (not discounting the men here, but the SPN ladies are something special) when I need advice or I am feeling low, or when I’m stuck across town and want to kill a few hours. This was the best unexpected side effect of being cast on this show, and I am forever grateful to be a part of the SPNFamily. There is nothing more important than having magical women in your life that you can trust to show your entire true self to—the good, the bad, the ugly, the badass. How lucky I am that Supernatural has given me that . . . and so much more.</p><p class="calibre_1">I have such wonderful memories of meeting the fans and seeing how the fandom itself grew from fans to family. Thank you so much for helping me find—and own—my light!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_48"></div>
