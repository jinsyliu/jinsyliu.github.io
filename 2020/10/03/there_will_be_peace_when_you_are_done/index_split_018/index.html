</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">“Y ou hurt?” came a voice from above.</p><p class="calibre_1">Someone offered Dean a hand. He accepted the help and was pulled from the ground, from the spot where he had almost died, yet again, if not for this stranger saving his life. It didn’t take long for those of us watching the episode to learn the stranger’s identity.</p><p class="calibre_1">It was César, hunting partner of Jesse, pursuing the same bizarre monsters (bizarre even by Supernatural standards) Sam and Dean were—monsters that emerged, cicada-like, every twenty-seven years to occupy the bodies of their victims and reproduce before killing their hosts and going back underground.</p><p class="calibre_1">When they were kids, one of these creatures took Jesse’s older brother Matty, never to be seen again. Jesse had been seeking revenge ever since, and having joined forces with César, they were closing in on their prey.</p><p class="calibre_1">I learned a bit more about César and Jesse soon after that initial introduction as they sat around a table in a bar with Sam and Dean:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">DEAN: Ah, you guys fight just like brothers [chuckles], almost as bad as us.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">CÉSAR: Well, [pause], it’s more like an old married couple.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">DEAN: [laughs] That’s . . . [looks to César]</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">César gives Dean a knowing look. Dean turns to Jesse.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">DEAN: [with realization] Oh, so . . . [points back and forth from Jesse to César]</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">CÉSAR: Yeah.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">DEAN: Okay, that’s . . .</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">César puts his beer bottle on the table and looks at Dean, while Jesse remains silent.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">DEAN: What’s it like, settling down with a hunter?</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">CÉSAR: Smelly, dirty. [turns to Jesse] Twice the worrying about getting ganked.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Sam smiles understandingly and looks away.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">So normal. I loved César immediately because he was so normal. He was not a stereotype. His sexuality was part of his DNA, not his defining attribute. He was gay, like me, and the fact that he was a man made him no less relatable. He was so honest, and for a hunter, so open. He takes a risk telling Dean that he and Jesse are a couple, yet Sam and Dean take it in stride immediately.</p><p class="calibre_1">For a single-episode character, César stuck with me. I loved César’s instant chemistry with the Winchesters and his obvious love for his partner. I connected with him in the way he showed his love, both through his sacrifices for his partner and in his drive to help Jesse get what he needed. It struck me that I have loved people who, like Jesse, endured a past they never deserved. I have desperately wished I could erase the pain of those experiences, and in that way, I’ve experienced things from César’s point of view. I am also lucky enough to have a wife who has sacrificed her own ambitions for my unique career more times than I can count over our twenty-seven years together. In that way, like Jesse, I’ve been on the receiving end of someone else’s sacrifice. I could relate to both characters.</p><p class="calibre_1">At the start of this episode, a young Jesse confides in his trusted older brother about a kiss at school with another boy. Matty warns him to be careful, but he is nothing but supportive. This scene was extremely touching to me because I remember being young, and gay, and feeling like I was the only girl who had ever loved another girl. Some of the best “firsts” in my life were with someone of the same sex, and I instinctively knew that I needed to keep my excitement over these early relationships to myself. At fifteen, I had no one else to confide in. It was isolating when my other female friends chatted away about first boyfriends and first dates while I felt it was safer for me to keep quiet. By nineteen, I had found another teenager (another gay woman) who understood. Finding that one person I could share my experiences with was completely freeing.</p><p class="calibre_1">Writer Nancy Won chose to show that Matty accepts Jesse the way he is, and he even has plans to move with him to a safer place where a gay kid might not be harassed as badly as he would have been in their hometown. This struck me as a truly unconditional love between brothers. I remember thinking how wonderful it was that Jesse had a protector and that he was going to have it easier than most gay kids have it in real life. The fact that Matty was gone soon after Jesse confided in him was devastating and made Jesse’s quest for revenge believable to me. His support system had been stripped away. I was worried for him. I understood the importance of having that one person you could confide in, and the thought of losing that, at that age, was heartbreaking.</p><p class="calibre_1">As I grew up, I saw very few depictions of nonstereotypical female characters on TV, let alone gay characters. The gay characters I remember in movies or TV shows were usually there for comic relief. They were silly or, worse, they were criminal deviants or the deserving victims of a crime they had obviously brought upon themselves through their own actions. I never related to these characters and, perhaps for that reason, combined with the fact that I wasn’t aware that I knew any gay adults, I did not consider myself gay for many years. What I saw in the media regarding gay people was often sad and ugly. What I experienced in my own life was the exact opposite. For me, love with another woman was love on a level I never thought possible. It was fundamentally different from my early relationships with guys. It was soul-expanding and beautiful and just right.</p><p class="calibre_1">Since loving someone in secret was nothing new to me, perhaps it’s not surprising that I watched and loved Supernatural in isolation for the first five years from 2005 to 2010. I was embarrassed that I, a grown adult with a full life, an amazing wife, and a job I love, could feel so passionately about characters on a TV show. I didn’t want to admit I loved something that was deemed so silly and superficial by society in general, but society’s disapproval was also nothing new, so I kept right on loving Supernatural and the story of Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection as they went about saving the world. The writing in those early years made me care deeply about these characters, and it was something I couldn’t quit, no matter what society thought.</p><p class="calibre_1">Around 2010, I bumped around the net until I stumbled across the Supernatural Fan Wiki. This was a comparatively old, disorganized site originally founded by a teenager and cobbled together by a series of fan administrators over the years. Nevertheless, here I’d found a place where other fans were talking about episodes . . . about the plot . . . about more than how hot Jared and Jensen were . . . and the fans on the site were even using decent grammar in their discussions! I created an account for myself. I started commenting. Little did I know the ways in which my life would change when I tentatively created that first wiki username.</p><p class="calibre_1">During the course of those episode discussions with other fans, I found Nikki, Gisa, Karen, and Katie, four women who, for this only child, are the sisters I never had. They are incredibly smart, articulate, caring, and devoted friends who went from being strangers on the wiki to being people I message daily. The things I’ve been able to do with this group and the incredible support they’ve given me have gone beyond my wildest expectations. This group of friends, who would not be in my life at all if not for Supernatural, has changed who I am, and they’ve taken me places I never thought I’d go.</p><p class="calibre_1">Our friendship led to annual meet-ups on a convention weekend with our group of five that went from, “I’ll just do this once” to “I will do this every year come hell or high water.” For several in this group, meeting at a convention requires cross-country flights and long drives, but all of us make it a priority because our friendship has become a priority.</p><p class="calibre_1">At conventions we discuss the show in depth. We calm each other’s nerves before photo ops. We eat pie. So. Much. Pie. We laugh until we cry. Early on, when the offerings in the vendor’s room didn’t live up to our expectations, we started making gifts for each other that were better and more meaningful than those we could buy. We watched the costume contests and ultimately entered with a group costume. We built a Supernatural-style motel room with my wife Suzanne contributing her carpentry skills, complete with retro wallpaper, a green couch, a sunburst clock, and a star-shaped room divider, taking second place in Minneapolis in 2017 and first in Chicago the next year. (Two people were seated to make up the couch with an arm in each armrest, another supported the wall, and everyone else was pressed into service as stagehands moving everything on and offstage quickly.) This loner actually worked with a group.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00073.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_16">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">When a businessman in a three-piece suit shared an elevator with me during the Chicago con in 2014, he asked in a hushed tone, “Have you SEEN the people here?!” Apparently he was not used to a rainbow sea of flannel punctuated by the occasional set of devil horns and massive black angel wings. I knew with confidence that I was telling him the truth when I replied, “Actually, I’m one of those people.”</p><p class="calibre_1">At our first shared convention, I felt I had found my tribe. These women are family. Those feelings only intensified over the years as our bond grew and led to some truly incredible experiences that expanded my world and nudged me in unexpected new directions. My love for the show led to a crazy seven-hour drive from central Illinois to Lawrence, Kansas, with Nikki to visit and photograph Mary, a replica Impala owned by Marcus and Megan Woodard. They had Mary restored down to the last detail, from the glossy black paint to the plastic soldiers in the ashtray, the Legos in the vents, and the carved initials on the back deck. They filled the trunk with a completely accurate weapons cache inside a hidden weapons box until their car resembled Dean’s Baby as closely as possible.</p><p class="calibre_1">Marcus and Megan spent years taking Mary to conventions and using those appearances to raise $7,000 for local Kansas charities, including the Kansas City Anti-Violence Project, an organization that helps LGBTQ victims of bullying. All in all, by partnering with other charities, they used Mary to raise a staggering total of $45,000 for a variety of worthy causes. When Nikki and I set out to meet a stranger who owned a ’67 Impala, I never thought I would find a straight man who was such a tireless supporter of gay rights. I started to feel that allies outnumbered bigots, at least within the Supernatural Family. Marcus spent hours with us, even though he was mere days away from moving halfway across the country and had plenty of other things he could have been doing. I was touched by his self-lessness, how generous he was with his time, and his dedication to making sure we, these strangers he had just met, got all the photos we wanted, no matter how long it took.</p><p class="calibre_1">Nikki and I braved wearing flannel in 93-degree heat and enlisted Marcus’s help in taking photos with Mary, aiming to recreate some stills from the show. This was something I had wanted to do for several years while I looked for an Impala owner willing to go along, and something I never actually would have done before meeting Nikki and my other SPN sisters. Before that trip, I had been afraid someone would think a photo shoot with a car was a silly waste of time. It was a challenge to explain to family at home why we were going so far to visit a car that we were not going to buy . . . just visit. The photos and the entire trip were most definitely not a waste of time.</p><p class="calibre_1">While in Kansas, I never expected to attend a Sunday service at the Stull Methodist Church. Instead of snooping around the Stull cemetery—I had read that the church was not crazy about that for fear of vandalism—I thought, why not meet the real people who lived there? But church? Me? No thanks. Nikki, a regular churchgoer, basically told this atheist “just come on” and we went. The Stull congregation was extremely welcoming. There was not a portal to hell in sight and nothing burst into flames when this nonbeliever stepped into the sanctuary. Making even a temporary connection with the people who lived there was more rewarding than I ever thought it could be. I would never have had this experience without Nikki, and I would never have met Nikki without Supernatural. Nikki is the kind of friend who will go to the ends of the earth for me. She is endlessly supportive and encouraging. I don’t think any friend has made me laugh harder. I don’t think anyone has a bigger heart.</p><p class="calibre_1">Another friendship forged on the wiki led to a flight to Austin to meet up with Gisa. Gisa is my complete opposite in many ways. She is always on the move, in charge, and incredibly outgoing. She pushes me and encourages me and is my ceaseless cheerleader in every endeavor. If not for Supernatural bringing us together, I likely would never have approached her, and now I can’t imagine my life without her.</p><p class="calibre_1">One goal that Gisa and I had in Austin was to visit the Family Business Beer Company in its third month in operation. We sat on the large porch with our second (perhaps third) awesome beer as the moon rose over a peaceful grove of live oaks swaying in the spring breeze. This place I’d never been to before felt as comfortable to me as if I were a regular. We also checked out the cozy San Jac Saloon, relaxing with a drink at the end of a day spent exploring Austin.</p><p class="calibre_1">We spent a few golden late afternoon hours roaring around the back roads of Texas in Renegade, another fan replica Impala owned by Lisa Diamont. Lisa cranked the classic rock, revved the engine, and we flew down the two-lane blacktop with the windows down, resulting in the most worth-it bad hair day in history. The engine growled, the road stretched out in front of us, and it was amazing to see everything from Sam and Dean’s perspective. We also got a lot of envious stares at stoplights. We continued what was fast becoming a bit of a tradition when we parked the car and Lisa helped us take photos recreating some of our favorite scenes and promo shots. Lisa was completely on board with the plan and already had several locations in mind when we arrived. She did all of this after a long day at her job as a teacher. The amazing generosity and enthusiasm of fellow fans never fails to make me smile. In fact, I don’t think I stopped smiling during our entire time with Lisa and Renegade. Taking the photos this time, I no longer worried about what anyone else might think.</p><p class="calibre_1">The wiki connection also led to Karen, a veterinarian, an editor, and a veritable SPN encyclopedia. Karen is one of the kindest people I know, the type of person who will leave her phone on next to her bed all night, halfway across the country, in case I need a vet on call at 3 a.m. when my cat is recovering from surgery. This is just another example of fans putting others before themselves. Karen’s work ethic and devoted friendship led to both of us becoming more involved with the wiki, where we are now co-admins.</p><p class="calibre_1">Through my friendship with Nikki, I was introduced to smart, observant, wickedly funny Katie. Mutual love for those who create Supernatural pushed me and Katie, both natural, dedicated introverts, to get up the nerve to talk to the actors we admired so much at conventions, encouraging each other through each attempt. Katie, though quiet, always has my back and is enthusiastically willing to try any crazy thing I suggest. Photo op test shots? She’s there. Rainbow slinky races down the hotel stairs at 1 a.m. (okay, that was her idea)? She’s there. Can I buy another photo op (FYI, the answer is usually “no”)? She’s there to remind me of what’s really important and save me from myself.</p><p class="calibre_1">As my comfort level increased, I suddenly had the desire to host open house events in our hotel room at the cons, inviting complete strangers in to appreciate Supernatural-themed art and eat pie. That out-of-character gesture was rewarded when I saw new friends who had met at one of our open houses—people who had bravely come to the convention alone—spending the rest of the convention weekend together. I had previously never wanted to talk to strangers, let alone help facilitate strangers talking to each other. I have an easier time talking to any stranger now, and I credit some of that to my amazing Supernatural sisters.</p><p class="calibre_1">Over the years, these friendships have become an intrinsic part of my life. We support each other’s business ventures, gladly take middle-of-the-night texts when someone has a family member in the hospital, and our group is a place where we can, and do, say anything.</p><p class="calibre_1">Speaking of business ventures, Supernatural started to seep into my work. I’m a professional custom bookbinder who does commissioned work for people all over the world. I spend most of my time creating bindings to other’s specifications, and that is rewarding in its own way, but Supernatural gave me new ideas I wanted to try, so I started doing bindings of Supernatural-themed books. Sometimes they were for myself, sometimes they were gifts for friends, and eventually, some were special orders placed by other fans. The designs I wanted to create required materials and techniques I had not tried before, materials like bullet casings. Where in the world does one find bullet casings? I found a source for them, and the desire to incorporate these elements into my work meant inventing new techniques for crafting book covers. After more than two decades as a bookbinder, I felt new inspiration and attempted designs that pushed my skills to the limit.</p><p class="calibre_1">The hammered silver jewelry I was making as a side business started to take a decidedly Supernatural turn as it morphed into designs inspired by the shapes of old motel signs—the kind I’d seen in Jerry Wanek’s amazing sets.</p><p class="calibre_1">First, I made silver cuff bracelets for my group of convention friends that included a piece of steel from the body of a ’67 Impala. The group loved them, and I loved the idea of using part of an actual vintage car in my metalwork. That experiment with the cuff bracelets made me want to collect more materials, and that necessitated learning how to dismantle a car body with an angle grinder. I had to get over my fear of intimidating power tools in order to obtain what I needed to complete the designs I was sketching.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00083.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_7">

Pigskin and goatskin leather, carved board, various colors of goatskin leather inlay, hot foil stamping.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I ended up scouring vintage car salvage yards across South Dakota, accompanied by my ever-patient wife Suzanne, in search of specific colors of vintage body steel to use in my jewelry. The evolution of my jewelry designs compelled me to walk into the salvage yard offices, overseen by men who could easily have been Bobby’s clone, ignore their confused looks, and describe what I was searching for. After a short conversation about why this lone woman had walked up their long dirt road (on the occasions when Suzanne stayed with our truck), they were always extremely helpful. It was getting easier to speak up for myself. It felt empowering.</p><p class="calibre_1">The amazing connections I can attribute to Supernatural reach outside the world of the wiki and conventions. I had limited experience selling my jewelry at art fairs until my current art fair partner, Lydia, approached me when she saw a photo of Jared and Jensen on my iPad start-up screen when we happened to be selling at the same show in 2016. What began with, “You like Supernatural?” has turned into partnering at twenty-two art sales and counting, with plans for future collaborations.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00095.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_6">

(right) Forged sterling silver motel pendant featuring steel from a ’67 Impala.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I began to realize that taking a chance, no matter what the outcome, was its own reward. Sometimes it’s a failure, but sometimes it’s a spectacular success, as it was when I risked reaching out and opening up to my four SPN sisters. I can be myself with them. We love the show with equal intensity and we have come to love each other as well. Perhaps because we each started out loving Supernatural alone, the fact that we can now love it together has led to an extremely rare feeling of openness and honesty in our group. The fact that I’m the only one in the group who’s gay? No big deal. Not any kind of deal, actually. We live in different parts of the country, and we have very different backgrounds, families, religious beliefs, and careers, but there is something about loving Supernatural that means we have many of the same core values of loyalty, persistence, depth of feeling, and dedication to family and friends.</p><p class="calibre_1">It’s not only the connection with other fans that has made me feel like a part of something larger than myself. It’s also the willingness of the actors to connect with the fans that I believe sets the Supernatural Family apart and contributes to the feel of a vast, varied, caring, and accepting fandom.</p><p class="calibre_1">I started following actor Hugo Ateo on Twitter soon after he played César on “The Chitters” episode. On October 11, 2018, he posted:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00104.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_17">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">I had no idea. I guess I hadn’t thought about it much. Straight people play gay roles all the time and vice versa. I replied to that effect, and then he replied:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00007.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_18">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Wait, WHAT?! How crazy is it that a man who is actually gay was deemed “not believable as gay” by other casting directors? Yet Supernatural chose him to play a complex character who also happens to be gay. I’m extremely proud of the choices made by this show that I love. I hope this small but vital step shows some kind of evolution in the way gay characters are portrayed in the entertainment industry.</p><p class="calibre_1">Sexuality is personal. It is truly no one else’s business, but as long as prejudice exists, I feel it is important for those who might harbor some bigotry to know that gay people aren’t outsiders. We are your neighbors and coworkers and family members. We are people you meet and interact with every day. Supernatural approached this gay character in this way, as a person who is valuable and trusted and loved. There are gay members in almost every family. The Supernatural Family chooses to recognize that fact, not make a big deal out of it, and give us characters who feel extremely real because they have a depth that goes far beyond a stereotype.</p><p class="calibre_1">There is a great scene in “The Chitters” where César and Dean are talking while driving in the Impala about how revenge never really solves anything, but when someone is out for revenge, you can’t talk them out of it. Dean talks to César like he’s known him for years. There’s some level of instant comfort there between the characters, and that’s how I felt about César: instantly comfortable. This is also one of the very few times on the show that Sam and Dean consider partnering with another pair of hunters. They both seem to trust César and Jesse immediately, unlike any other single-episode characters I can recall. Perhaps the way César and Jesse are so honest with Sam and Dean about the nature of their relationship, and how important this hunt is for them, allows for the same sort of trust in return.</p><p class="calibre_1">Hugo Ateo played César as incredibly capable, loving, and understated. Normal. When César smiles near the end of the episode, talking excitedly about his plans to retire with Jesse (played by Lee Rumohr) to New Mexico and raise horses, I could feel the happiness there. I wanted the best for them. I also REALLY wanted them to become regular characters. I wanted more. I still hope for many more complex and capable gay characters like César on future shows.</p><p class="calibre_1">Of course, I also fell in love with Charlie (played by Felicia Day) several years earlier for some of the same reasons. She was another “oh, by the way, she’s gay” character, where that part of her life was a footnote to her other prominent traits of brains, compassion, self-doubt, and determination. I love Dean, but I never wanted to be Lisa. I always wanted to be Charlie, who became Dean’s best friend and the sister he never had.</p><p class="calibre_1">I loved Charlie so much that I jumped at the chance to meet Charlie’s creator, writer Robbie Thompson, at a DePaul University symposium in 2015, where he was the keynote speaker. I mean, come on, a college symposium weekend entirely focused on Supernatural? How awesome is that?! Robbie Thompson created Charlie with a subtle complexity that had more time to play out over multiple episodes. I loved that she could be supremely confident in some areas (leading a cosplay army) and completely terrified in others (breaking into the headquarters of leviathan Dick Roman). This made her believable to me. When I briefly discussed Charlie with Robbie Thompson, he said he put a great deal of thought into making sure that being gay was not her primary feature. Sam and Dean loved Charlie like family and the fact that she was gay posed no barrier between them in any way. As with César, the writers of Supernatural made her anything but a stereotype. They took the time to craft her as a fully realized character, which resulted in unforgettable, creative, and touching episodes like “Pac Man Fever,” which is still one of my all-time favorites. Robbie Thompson said he fought like hell for her character to continue, even though the decision was ultimately made by others to kill her off, a loss which still hurts, even now.</p><p class="calibre_1">Making the trip to speak to Robbie Thompson is one of the ways in which my love for these characters has pushed me to do things I would never have had the nerve to do before. It sounds crazy, even to me, but Supernatural has made me more fearless. More aware. More open. I’m not the same person I was in 2005.</p><p class="calibre_1">I have been lucky as a gay woman. For the most part, I have had extremely supportive friends and family members. I have never experienced the horrible things that many gay people have had to endure in order to survive. Perhaps that’s why I connected with César’s normalcy and Charlie’s almost-incidental sexuality. In Charlie, the writers of Supernatural gave us a fascinating character who always had the best of intentions and always worked to be stronger than her fear. In César, they gave us a character who earned our love and respect through his actions, the way we should all earn it.</p><p class="calibre_1">I was not looking for validation or acceptance when I watched Dean break into Sam’s Stanford apartment on September 13, 2005. I was simply tuning in to a new show whose promo, with the image of a woman burning on the ceiling, was unforgettable and extremely compelling. I didn’t think I wanted approval from anyone. It turns out I did want it and somehow found it in a TV show, of all places, and in an extended family of actors and fans. The relationships I’ve built within the Supernatural Family and the incredible acts of generosity, charity, and kindness I’ve witnessed in this fandom give me hope that love will ultimately win out over hate. The creative and emotional back roads the show has led me down leave me excited for the next essential, soul-expanding experience I never knew I needed.</p><p class="calibre_1">I am different now, and I am better.</p><p class="calibre_1">Validation, it turns out, feels very good.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00016.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_19">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><span class="italic">Chicago convention, 2014 My shirt reads, “Sam and Dean Winchester—Keeping gay girls just a little bit straight since 2005.” This is a risk I never would have taken before—a funny shirt photo op. Would Jared and Jensen get it? Was it even appropriate? I should not have worried. Jared chuckled and Jensen outright laughed and stopped the photo line, enlisting Jared to snap a picture of us with Jensen’s phone to send to a family member he thought would get a kick out of my shirt. I felt nothing but acceptance. When the two leads set such a welcoming, caring, accepting example, it’s no wonder that this fandom has felt that support and used it to evolve into a fundraising powerhouse as well as an international web of crucial friendships and incredible creativity.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_20"></div>
