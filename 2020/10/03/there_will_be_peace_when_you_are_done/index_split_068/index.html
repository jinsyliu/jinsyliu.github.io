</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Playing the character of Gadreel was a significant chapter in my career as an actor. Little did I know, though, at the time I’d booked the role, just how important a chapter it would become in my life—how I was entering a fandom so very special that one is often referred to as part of the SPNFamily. It’s an appropriate name, as I soon learned that few other fandoms share the same passion and consistency. I knew little about the character of Ezekiel going into the audition, other than he was an angel. I even found out afterward that the sides for the audition (a portion of a script used for the audition process) were Castiel’s lines from a previous episode.</p><p class="calibre_1">The audition went well enough that I ended up booking the role and was told the arc was for a couple of episodes. But it was important for me to know that Ezekiel was not who he said he was; my angel was just pretending to be Ezekiel! Again, not a lot to go on, but good enough to work with. My actor brain was off to the races. Was he a good guy or a bad guy, in the writers’ view? What was this angel’s motivation, his true intentions in this episode I’d been given? Was he an angel aware of the complexities of the modern world, or an angel of old from the Bible, beholden to a different time and rules? Questions, so many questions! Ones that are rarely answered for us actors. It was time to make choices.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00099.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_30">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Most trained actors love to do the work of preparing for a role. This is not something we’re usually given much time to do, and even when there is enough time, we rely on any information we’ve been given about the character and then mix that with our own choices and the backstory to bring the character to life. Preparation, in my experience, has been absolutely key to getting out of my own head and letting the character breathe. The times I’ve had the most anxiety before the first day playing a new character have almost always been when I feel like I haven’t had the time I needed to prepare. And of course, the times I’ve felt the calmest, most present, and most excited to get on with that first scene are when I’ve done the work. Then, there are those rare times where you read a character’s story and immediately connect and understand them on a kinetic level. I’ve had that only a few times in my career. Ezekiel (well . . . Gadreel) wasn’t that for me.</p><p class="calibre_1">I did research and read about both angels. Gadreel, the infamous protector of the Garden of Eden who happened to let the snake in, was subsequently punished and imprisoned for thousands of years. Ezekiel, on the other hand, was the opposite of Gadreel in reputation and character. And it’s clear why Gadreel initially pretended to be him. I made some choices of my own but also felt like being too prepared for this guy might sabotage me somewhat. I didn’t know how much the writers were going to base these angels in SPN on what I was able to ascertain about them online. I’d been given so little background on the character, so I knew that I’d probably be given some surprises regarding who the writers thought he was and the arc of where he was going. This is often the case in TV land, and you need to be prepared to scrap some of your choices on the day (“the day” being the minute you hear this new information on set and take it in the direction your bosses are asking you to go).</p><p class="calibre_1">My first day on set filming the episode “I Think I’m Gonna Like It Here” was a prime example of the surprises producers and directors will often drop on you at the last minute. The first scene I shot was my character getting off a bus. Easy peasy. I was then preparing for a significant scene of Ezekiel being trapped by Dean in a holy circle of fire. It was an intense and important scene, one where I was actually talking to and trying to achieve some trust from Jensen’s character, Dean.</p><p class="calibre_1">Literally five minutes before we were to film the scene, the director approached me and asked, “Do you want to see what Jared has done?”</p><p class="calibre_1">I knew that Jared and I would both be playing versions of this angel, as he inhabited each of our vessels, but I was under the impression that I was the first to play Ezekiel. Trying to calm the sudden panic that I was feeling, I replied, “What do you mean, ‘what Jared has done’? He hasn’t already shot scenes as this character, has he? I thought I was going first?”</p><p class="calibre_1">The director responded, “Oh no, he’s already done some scenes. So, do you want to see it? We need to get going here.”</p><p class="calibre_1">I could barely mask my sarcasm and panic as I said, “Do I want to see what the lead actor of the show has done already with the character I’m supposed to be imitating?! YES, I think that might be important to see.” Really, I wished I’d had more than the three minutes to take in what Jared had done, but I did appreciate his obvious confidence in my incredible acting abilities that I could in seconds mimic him.</p><p class="calibre_1">“Okay, then, let’s go to video village and check it out.”</p><p class="calibre_1">The scene he showed me was Jared playing Ezekiel and being very specific in his movement and cadence of speech. I breathed for the first time, because as I watched Jared’s performance, it was obvious that the choices he made were very much in line with the choices that I’d made. Jared was moving his body with almost ballerina-like fluidity. He’d taken on a Shakespearian cadence to the way he spoke. Two choices I’d made were to move in a specific way—something angelic was my thought—gentle and graceful, but with no doubt of the superhuman strength underneath. I’d practiced how I wanted Gadreel-as-Ezekiel to sound too, each word clear and pronounced.</p><p class="calibre_1">Once season 9 aired and I started doing the convention circuit, many of the fans complimented me on my imitation of Jared’s version of Ezekiel/Gadreel. I was flattered, but after explaining the actual sequence of events, a lot of them were surprised. Conversely, I’ve also heard from fans at conventions that they were impressed with Jared’s impression of me. Goes to show you that art is truly specific to the individual experiencing it. There are always many different reactions to an actor’s performance, but at the end of the day, it seemed most fans were happy with my work.</p><p class="calibre_1">My second day on set, I was in every scene with Jensen and Jared from the beginning of the day to the end. It was to be a huge day, with very emotional scenes and writing that required me to be sharp and emotionally available. (Well, Jared was playing like he was in a coma in bed, so not so heavy for him.) On my way to work, my best friend, who’s like a brother to me, called me to say that he’d just found out that one of his best and oldest friends (and also a friend of mine) had passed away. I had been completely consumed with the big day ahead of me, and when I heard the pain and disbelief in my brother’s voice at his dear friend’s passing, I was heartbroken that I couldn’t do more than listen and offer some words of love. Needless to say, the news of our friend’s death put me in a very somber, reflective state.</p><p class="calibre_1">Isn’t it always the case that when we lose someone, we stop for a moment to try and understand what it means that we won’t see them again? And then we are slapped in the face with the truth of how precious and fleeting it all is—how the things in life that were stressing us out, consuming us, are instantly put in their proper place of importance, and you know you’ve been obsessing over trivial matters? I had been worried about this first real day of work and how I would do. I had become obsessed about running my lines; I was going in circles about everything that could go wrong and not focusing instead on everything that might go right. This news reminded me, like a well-placed left hook, to keep my hands up, man (my hands being my wits and presence of mind to see what is both important and within my control).</p><p class="calibre_1">That day of intense work was everything I could have hoped it would be, but it was also filled with reflection and a heavy heart. I felt gratitude for many things I hadn’t acknowledged at the end of that day, and sadness at the passing of a talented, driven young man whose star was just about to shine.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Not long after this episode aired, I got my first glimpse of the Supernatural community via Twitter. I’d only just started on Twitter, years late to the game. But as I stumbled along, I saw the huge number of people communicating about Gadreel and the show. Now to digress a little, I cut my teeth on an important, critically acclaimed show early in my career. That show (Battlestar Galactica) had found legions of loyal fans even though we’d missed social media by a few years. Sure, there were chat rooms discussing our show, but nothing that compared to the sheer size and reach of social media. So, as much as I thought I knew, I truly didn’t understand the potential of this new way of communicating with the world. Social media has allowed fandoms of shows like Supernatural the ability to reach out to thousands, if not millions, instantly.</p><p class="calibre_1">And then there’s streaming. Being able to watch Supernatural on Netflix led to a renaissance with a new generation of fans—ones whose parents would not have let them watch it when they were younger. They binged the show, and then, being the generation that they are, obsessively communicated about it online. This turned Supernatural from a long-running series with a consistent, but not huge, audience to an ever-growing heavyweight that showed no signs of stopping in its rebirth.</p><p class="calibre_1">What I thought would be two episodes for my character turned into three. Then when I was off filming a feature in Calgary, I got the call that Supernatural wanted me back for another three episodes—news that I was very happy to receive. It would take me out of pilot season and allow me to play this character again . . . a character I had so much fun doing with this great group of guys and crew.</p><p class="calibre_1">More than five years have passed since then, and only recently have I not felt like an active member of the family. I went from doing the show to interacting with the fandom via social media. Not long after, I was contracted to do the convention circuit for almost fifteen months straight, which ended up garnering more conventions with the gang overseas for the next few years. It’s only been the last year that I haven’t been on the circuit with them as often, and I do look forward to doing it again.</p><p class="calibre_1">Being a part of the gang on the convention circuit was without a doubt one of the highlights of my professional career. You’ve all heard the stories, but needless to say, the amount of laughter and taking the piss out of each other is unforgettable. We’ve all seen Richard Speight on stage commanding a crowd, but the way that man can tell a story—a story many of us have heard more than once—and still make it fresh and just as funny as the first time, is awesome. I honestly feel like everybody’s storytelling skills are on point when doing the circuit. If you’re going to hold court, especially at a meal, you better be sharp or they will tear you a new one like you’re a first-time comic bombing on stage. But as much as they give it to you, it’s always done in good fun and you’re forced to laugh at yourself.</p><p class="calibre_1">I think some people forget how hard the lead cast has worked for the last fifteen years. They somehow manage to do the long hours week after week and yet get home to their spouses and kids on the weekends. They also, generously, donate one weekend per month to attend conventions, giving back to the fandom and keeping it strong and always wanting, waiting for more.</p><p class="calibre_1">As I’ve mentioned, I came from a show that is one of the most critically acclaimed televisions shows of the last twenty years. For those of you who haven’t seen it, Battlestar Galactica is a must. Those castmates of mine are family; they always will be. But, to be blessed enough in this short career that many of us have to say that I experienced a special bond with the cast of another series, one that I did for only one season, is a real blessing. With the SPN gang, I’ve enjoyed incredibly funny travel experiences with a group of amazing people on a show that, when all is wrapped and done, will have run strong for fifteen seasons. I played such a minuscule part of this record-running show, yet I was treated like family by the cast and fans alike. Anyone who’s experienced an SPN convention has been entertained by the many different faces of guests that are staples on the circuit.</p><p class="calibre_1">Performances aside, there are so many individual talents and characteristics that the fans look forward to with each of these guests, such as the lovely Ruth Connell, who plays Rowena, who I only recently learned is also quite the singer. Speaking of singers, there’s a murderer’s row of them in the gang. Rob Benedict, who plays Chuck Shurley (aka God), is the lead singer and guitarist of the fantastic band Louden Swain, which also includes guitarist Billy Moran, bassist Michael Borja, and drummer Stephen Norton, all talented musicians and beautiful human beings. Jensen, when he graces the fans, can carry a fine tune. Briana Buckmaster (Sheriff Donna Hanscum) has a great set of pipes, and I always look forward to hearing her perform. Gil McKinney (Henry Winchester), is a wonderful singer, and having done a number of conventions with him before, I found out much later how talented he is, which was an awesome surprise to me and many of his fans. And who can forget the smart and talented songbird Jason Manns, whose song “Vision” had a cameo on the Impala’s short-lived iPod? For those who’ve never met the man, you might, at first glance, think “former linebacker,” but get to know him and you quickly find that he’s smart, well read, has the voice of an angel, and, to top it off, is a well-mannered Southern gentleman. As I said, all these guests bring their unique talents to the table. Watching Sebastian Roché, the charming, never-aging Frenchman who plays Balthazar, absolutely woo a crowd of screaming fans as he fluently switches among three different languages is a sight to behold.</p><p class="calibre_1">Richard Speight, most often the master of ceremonies, is a master indeed. The man makes the job look easy on stage, like he just came out of a nice hot shower, one cup of coffee in, holding court on stage to the joy of the fans. It’s hard to mention Rich without Rob Benedict. These two best friends have incredible comedic timing on stage and off.</p><p class="calibre_1">Then there’s the talented Alaina Huffman (Abaddon/Josie Sands), who’s become a friend and someone I always look forward to seeing on the circuit. Matt Cohen (young John Winchester) is a gem, and an awesome dad and husband. His enthusiasm and energy are the reason he cohosts the most with Rich on the road and at conventions overseas.</p><p class="calibre_1">There are a few people I’ve never really had the chance to get to know, but I’m a true fan of their work. Mark Pellegrino (Lucifer) is such a talented actor, and I’ve been a fan of his work since I can remember. Then there are a few who I’ve met outside of conventions. Samantha Smith (Mary Winchester) is another wonderful actor I hadn’t seen in years, and I only recently got to see her smiling face at a convention again.</p><p class="calibre_1">And who can forget the wonderful Felicia Day (Charlie Bradbury)? We met over ten years ago when she came on the series Dollhouse to work with us for a few episodes. I’ve been a huge fan of her work ever since. She’s incredibly bright, funny, and driven. And of course I have to mention Curtis Armstrong (Metatron). I’ve been a fan of this man’s work since I was a kid. I was delighted when I found out that I’d be working with him—and even more so once I got to know him better. He talks fondly of being a father and passionately about theater and film. He is a seasoned veteran and a generous performer who makes acting with him a breeze.</p><p class="calibre_1">I could write chapters on all of the incredible people I’ve met on the Supernatural circuit, but I will save that for another book. I’d be remiss without mentioning the incredible fans I’ve met, and the staff and promoters I’ve had the pleasure of working for. Chris Schmelke is a sweetheart of a photographer for Creation Conventions, and he knows all the regular guests and greets them by name. Speaking of Creation Conventions, I have to mention the founders, the bosses of the show and arguably the creators of the modern convention: Gary Berman and Adam Malin. I’ve had the pleasure of working with a few of their excellent staff, including Stephanie Dizon, boss lady and a talented performer herself, Jen Gregory, Jen Gannon, Victoria, and Mary—all fantastic at their jobs and great to work with.</p><p class="calibre_1">The conventions often are a perfect blend of music and fun, coupled with all the other standard convention practices of signing autographs, taking pictures, and hosting Q&amp;As. But this fandom doesn’t seem to tire of seeing the same guests and hearing many of the same stories. I think it’s clear that they’ve all found a community, where regardless of age, race, sexual orientation, or religion, everyone is accepted and safe. When I’m at a convention, I see little fear or intolerance. Instead, I see community, acceptance, and a shared love for a show about a couple of evil-fighting brothers and their loyal angel. People spend their hard-earned money to travel for another weekend, to another SPN con, to experience largely the same thing again and again. And it’s plainly clear that the thing is so damn good, that even if it’s the only real vacation that these fans will get all year, they’re good with that. These fans have found a tribe with people from all over the world. They’ve bonded over their love of Supernatural, and over the course of countless conventions, meals, evenings of dancing, laughter, and fun, have formed lasting friendships.</p><p class="calibre_1">I have been doing the convention circuit for close to twenty years, and I’ve had countless conversations with numerous fans. Many have communicated to me that they were not extremely social growing up. Many were shy and had, or still have, social anxiety issues. But what they’ve found is that they feel safe and accepted at the conventions. Here is a space where other people do not judge them at all for those issues, but embrace and care for them.</p><p class="calibre_1">There are many misconceptions about the fans, one being that they’re all shy and reserved. That’s true at times, but I’ve seen these people, especially at the SPN conventions, dance and party like it’s 1999. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more outgoing and expressive group when they’re on the dance floor or on stage at karaoke singing with the guests.</p><p class="calibre_1">Alas, it is now official that the fifteenth year will be the last season. Fifteen seasons . . . such a rarity in the world of episodic television. Supernatural will forever hold a place among only a handful of shows. I’ve heard fans for a number of years now dread the inevitable end of the show and what that’ll mean for them and the conventions. But from what I’ve seen from this fandom, after all the years I’ve been in the business, specifically the genre business, I’d be surprised if the conventions ever stop. Maybe they won’t happen with the same regularity, but with fifteen seasons and hundreds of episodes to discuss and dissect, there’s little chance the Supernatural fandom will cease to exist in my lifetime.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Finally, for those who’ve seen me talk on stage, you’ve heard me speak at length about meditation and how it has helped me. I’ve always been a proponent of meditation, and I’ve tried to encourage people to take up the practice. I don’t think I would have had the forum to speak to so many people in many different cities about meditation if it weren’t for the SPN conventions. Wanting to share my passion for meditation and its healing abilities with as many people as I could, I jumped at the opportunity when my hypnotherapist, the wonderful Joanne Harris, suggested we start a meditation app. Now, we encountered many problems in our venture, but I’m incredibly touched whenever Joanne shares with me another message from someone who used our meditation site and communicated how it has helped them.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’ll always be proud of the time that when asked at a convention whether I thought meditation could help young children, I carefully answered that I thought it could. I did also remind everyone that I’m not a therapist or a psychologist, but I feel that meditation can help most anyone of every age. A year later, the person who asked that question was in one of the roundtable VIP sessions. (For those who don’t know, these consist of a small table of fans, usually ten or so, who sit with a rotating cast of actors for forty-five minutes of conversation.) She asked me if I remembered her asking the question. I said I did, and then she told me she was a teacher and that she started regular meditation with her seven-year-old students, with amazing results. She shared that they all became enthusiastic about it after it became a regular practice, and even more importantly, she noticed the children becoming calmer, less prone to emotional outbursts, and, most importantly, able to resolve and deal with their conflicts better. It still makes me smile thinking about this, to know that I played a small part in it. I do hope we get to a day where meditation is taught to all children.</p><p class="calibre_1">I’m honored to have been asked to share some of my experiences in this book for the fans. I hope I’ve communicated how important being a part of this show has been for me not only professionally, but also personally. I feel incredibly blessed to have been a part of this community, and I look forward to continued connections with the fans in the future on the convention circuit and through social media. Be well, my friends!</p><p class="calibre_1">“When they say my name, perhaps I will be remembered, not as the one who let the serpent in, but as one of the few who helped give heaven a second chance.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_70"></div>
