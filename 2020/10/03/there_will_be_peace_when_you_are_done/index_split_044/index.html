</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">Igraduated from college in 2006—on the cusp of what was going to become the Great Recession. I earned a bachelor’s degree in creative writing from a small Midwest university—practical, right? Afterwards, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with it or for a career, and so I drifted the summer after graduation. I landed—not surprisingly in hindsight—into retail. That was supposed to be a temporary gig while I looked for something in my field or decided on graduate school or something. Anything but working in a retail store! But Black Friday and Christmas came and went and came and went and came and went again (and one more time. Yikes!). And then the Great Recession hit and it was hold on to what you’ve got and ride the wave.</p><p class="calibre_1">So, what does any of that have to do with Supernatural? You’ll see.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">In 2010, something wonderful happened to me. I decided to take a “stay-cation” and attend my alma mater’s latest incarnation of a writer’s festival. I had longed to return to my college days, exploring the beauty of language and the meanings lurking underneath. I wanted to retreat for a bit into a better time of my life—one that had a clear purpose and reason and goal. So, I stayed home for the week, getting up early enough to attend the day’s panels and other readings. While I would get ready or prepare for my stint back in college for the week, I discovered something: Supernatural.</p><p class="calibre_1">I believe that if it hadn’t been for this “stay-cation,” I would have never found this show—and therefore, it would have never had a chance to change my life on such a fundamental level.</p><p class="calibre_1">The story about these two brothers sucked me in almost immediately, making me wonder who Sam and Dean (or as I called them then, Floppy-Haired Boy and Pouty-Lipped Boy) were and what their search for their father meant. I loved how complex and real the story felt for a show that dealt with demons and ghosts. I lived for the humor and the emotional moments—and something I had thought lost broke inside, free once more. Creativity started back again after a dormancy. Retail isn’t exactly the most motivating environment for a creative writer—or creative anything—and so for a few years I hadn’t done anything but work and nap and work some more. Supernatural stirred my blood and sucked me into its dark and beautiful world in a matter of a week’s time. The reruns on TNT allowed me to become invested in a show that had been on for a number of years by then—and I eagerly got caught up.</p><p class="calibre_1">It wasn’t until I began to dip my toes into the fandom, however, that the show started to change my life. Supernatural has this uncanny ability to make us pay attention and watch the story closely for all sorts of reasons. It has layers of meaning, emotional connections, and a heartbeat about family at its center. That heartbeat is also ever present in the fandom that surrounds it. Originally, I had been cautious and nervous about joining this fandom, considering that my other previous fandoms had soured through considerable backbiting and other issues—but I had been much younger then. Maybe I was ready now. I dipped my toes in, looking at fanfic first. My creativity surged based on the sheer skill this fandom had.</p><p class="calibre_1">I stumbled across a review site—the Winchester Family Business—and started to dip my toes in more. I commented on other pieces about episodes, leaving novel-length analyses. I hadn’t really done any real “review” or commentary on text since college. I didn’t even know if I could still do it—if the skill after all these years had atrophied. I found, however, that I indeed could write these reaction papers that I had done repeatedly through my college career for novels, short stories, and other classmates’ works. I found that it brought color to my world. Before Supernatural, my world had become so gray and colorless—a monotony of same thing, different day. So, I kept reading the reviews posted, piecing together the things I noticed in the episode and what the reviewer said, and regained my voice.</p><p class="calibre_1">By that summer, I had cobbled together my first piece for the Winchester Family Business—a deep look at Soulless Sam, a character that fascinated me for all of his implications about sociopaths, humanity, and the meaning of family bonds and love. I submitted it to the website owner, Alice Jester, in hopes that I’d at least get one piece published on her site. I hadn’t thought about writing more than that, figuring that so many others had already cornered that market. The essay was academic on so many levels and not necessarily the light fare some might want from a website, after all. To my surprise, my writing really took off.</p><p class="calibre_1">People enjoyed my work. They liked what I had to say. I felt encouraged and kept going.</p><p class="calibre_1">And at the same time, half of a novel started brewing in my mind, and I started working on it in earnest. Supernatural had given me writing back. But it wasn’t done changing my life by a mile.</p><p class="calibre_1">That change occurred when I started to attend conventions. The exhilaration of meeting the cast drew me to my first one—but what kept me going back again and again were the friends I had made in the fandom. These people became more than screen names. They became sisters and brothers—and for an only child, it was a new experience! I found myself welcomed and celebrated for who I was, and I also found that my views had impacted others just as theirs had impacted me. A community had formed around this little show that could, and in so doing, it had accepted me fully into its ranks.</p><p class="calibre_1">Our fandom isn’t perfect. There’s some of the negative energy that permeates any community, but at its heart, the fandom is truly an SPNFamily and we do rally together and support good work. My fandom inspires me to reach beyond myself—just as the show did when I first discovered its beautiful take on our complex world. I became an activist for causes that came from cast and crew alike. I supported Supernatural Assistant Director Kevin Parks as he honored Kim Manners (one of the show’s original producers and directors) in his cancer rides. I supported Misha Collins and his efforts to promote kindness through Random Acts. I jumped on board, totally, for Jared Padalecki when he launched the Always Keep Fighting campaign. I supported Mark Sheppard (who played Crowley) and his efforts to stamp out type 1 diabetes, reviving another skill I hadn’t used in years: embroidery. I rallied behind the fandom for all their efforts to answer cries for help in the wake of storms like Hurricane Sandy. I may not have had much money to share, but I gave what I could and promoted and did my part.</p><p class="calibre_1">I didn’t know it at the time, but Supernatural was changing me yet again. We don’t need to hash out the 2016 election here—or go into detail about how I feel about the results—but I feel like Supernatural and the SPNFamily prepared me to be ready in its aftermath. I had become active in so many wonderful causes because of my fandom and my show—and now it translated into the real world in more ways than one. Not only would it help me champion such causes as internet freedom, public media, and civil rights, but it would also lead me to finding my real career path—even if I’m not quite where I want to be just yet.</p><p class="calibre_1">In season 8, Supernatural introduced the Men of Letters (not to be confused with the British version we see in season 12). The notion that the world of Supernatural didn’t just have hunters who went about “saving people, hunting things, the family business” but also wanted to study that world, catalog it, and assist through librarianship triggered something deep inside. I have always loved to read and to write (hence my degree!). The world of storytelling and language has had me in its grip since I learned to read at the age of five. (For the record, while Metatron turned out to be a real asshat in many ways, I identified with his intense need to read everything and devote time to stories. It would be a dream of mine to spend millennia reading and writing as many stories as possible. Metatron did just that after leaving heaven behind. He created the best witness protection program ever. Until the Winchesters burst into his life, he spent all his time exploring the depths of our literary merits. It is why he tells Castiel, “Now do you understand that the universe is made up of stories, not atoms,” in the episode “Meta Fiction.” To him, story is humanity’s pinnacle achievement, and I find myself in utter agreement with the former Scribe of God. I’ve played with words, stories, and books my whole life. At one point, I had thought about running my own bookstore. I had been so blind to the notion that I should aspire to do and be more.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural prodded me in the right direction at the right time. It reminded me that not everything has to be a literal “business.” The Men of Letters and their beautiful library in the bunker changed everything for me. Here was a treasure trove of information—some that would have been very helpful to the brothers much, much earlier. Sure, Sam and Dean used libraries in the earlier seasons to great effect. It was part of their formula in many ways: hit up the public library for the local details about an area’s history and the case—look up some lore and other pertinent details—and use their brains to make their brawn count. Sam and Dean have always used their knowledge base and research abilities to do their job. On some level, their use of the public library connected to me because it reminded me of writing research papers in college—using bits of information to form a new whole.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">The Men of Letters who opened the bunker originally described it as a “last beacon of hope.” I feel, on many levels, that libraries and librarians are exactly that. The access to knowledge, education, and community can change everything. It can build a better world. It can bridge divides. It can illuminate our path. It can expand our world beyond the one we’ve always known. Libraries allow us to explore any and every subject, to learn and to grow, and to understand one another through the beauty of language and story. Nonfiction and fiction alike give us windows into other people’s lives, other cultures, other ways of being. The bunker and the Men of Letters through Henry Winchester did just that for Sam and Dean—and for me.</p><p class="calibre_1">That was the introduction; it was Charlie Bradbury (played by Felicia Day) who sealed my fate. Sam describes her as the “smartest person in the room.” Since her introduction in season 7, I related to her character on many levels—wanting to emulate some of the qualities that writer Robbie Thompson imbued her with: loyalty, a love of geek culture, a great ability to love, and a deep sense of justice. Charlie represents the person I feel is trapped inside me, and seeing her represented on screen truly meant everything. In her effort to help Dorothy and piece together the mystery surrounding the Wicked Witch, she made the comment, “Hey, these guys may have been sexist, but like all librarians, they were wicked smart, too.” She’s right. Librarians, those I’ve had the honor to work with and meet, are wicked smart. They may not know everything about a single subject, but they know a little bit about everything—enough to send someone on the right path. They’re able to figure out how to navigate the endless fire hose of knowledge and information we now live with on a daily basis—and organize it.</p><p class="calibre_1">In that moment, hearing Charlie describe librarians as being wicked smart and vital? I felt a ping go off in my brain. I started volunteering at my local public library, learning the very basics of shelving and shelf reading and the little tasks that needed to be done so our librarians could do other things in the service of their patrons. I wanted to be counted among that select group of “wicked smart”—like Charlie. She had been dubbed a Woman of Letters by Sam, and suddenly I saw my world open before me, just waiting for me. I had drifted for so long, finding my voice in writing about this show and building relationships in the SPNFamily—but this gave me a purpose for my life and what career I should have.</p><p class="calibre_1">I want to make a difference in this world. I think it’s a fundamental desire that we all share in this life. We want it to mean something. We want to do something that matters. We want to leave a real and lasting mark on the world that will outlive our mortal lives. I hadn’t really known what I was searching for. I hadn’t the first notion of where to start.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural showed me the way. Supernatural took my hand when I needed it the most and said in its unique way, “Come with me if you want to live”—and there’s another geek reference to add to the list! This show showed me that life, while challenging, doesn’t have to be dreary or difficult with no purpose. It doesn’t have to be a string of losses or endless drudgery for big corporate profits. It can be to bring good into the world.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">Sam Winchester reminded me of that fact in season 12, when he said, “Well, I mean . . . guys like us, we’re not exactly the type of people they write about in history books, you know? But the people we saved, they’re our legacy. And they’ll remember us and then I guess . . . we’ll eventually fade away, too. That’s fine, because we left the world better than we found it, you know.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00033.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_23">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">And that’s the magic of Supernatural summed up. In the last three years, volunteering at my library has turned into a part-time job. I also started volunteering for a local literacy group that helps immigrants and refugees (or anyone who wants to learn) build on their English and math skills so they can become citizens. I’ve also focused my efforts on eliminating some debts so that I can eventually go on to get a master’s degree in library science.</p><p class="calibre_1">Each time I go to work at the library, I feel accomplished. Even when I am doing the smallest or most mundane task, I feel as if I’m facing down monsters and demons, just like Sam and Dean. Sure, mine aren’t literal or killing people, but they exist. I feel as if I’m battling back ignorance and misunderstanding. When I am helping a patron at my library with even the smallest of questions, I know I’m making a real difference in their life. It may not be tangible or fit in on a neat statistician’s sheet, but it has lasting impact. I have the same experience when I tutor. Whether I’m working with someone on a complex article about a civic right or duty, or working on basic grammar, I feel the real growth of knowledge. I know I’m contributing to a brighter future for someone working hard to make their way here in a new country. Most of all, I feel as if I’m building a better and stronger community—one that doesn’t have to shun our differences but rather chooses to embrace them.</p><p class="calibre_1">Because of Supernatural, I plan on making sure I leave the world better than when I found it.</p><p class="calibre_1">Because of Supernatural, I will become a Woman of Letters someday.</p><p class="calibre_1">If that’s not a show and a fandom changing lives, I don’t know what is.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00066.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_24">
</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_1">In the spring of 2019, my retail career came to an abrupt end. The store I worked at for nearly fourteen years met a grisly end at the hands of a private equity company. In the wake of that, I found myself in a more rewarding position at a group home. While working as a direct support person, I will also be attending graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee for a master’s degree in library sciences with an emphasis on public librarianship.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="italic">Supernatural was also in transition. At the same time that my store went belly-up, the cast and crew decided that season 15 would be the last. It hit an emotional nerve, reminding us that nothing lasts forever and the only true constant is change. Regardless, Supernatural changed my life and the lives of those it touched both on and off set. It will continue to do so long after the last time we see the boys on screen in the spring of 2020. Supernatural has a legacy: it is in all of us. The good that we do. We are Supernatural. We are SPNFamily. We are the fruits of its changing force for good.</span></p><p class="calibre_1">The show may end, but the fandom can continue to be its legacy. After all, family still don’t end with blood.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><img src="images/00044.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" class="calibre_34">
